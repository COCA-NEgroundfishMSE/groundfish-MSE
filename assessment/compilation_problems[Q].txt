I had issues compiling on the Linux system when I already had compiled objects transfered over from the Windows system.  Apparently if you have .o and .dll files in the directory then linux can't figure out how to run the compilation because first it is checking to see if you have compiled files or not and if you do it tests them to see if anything has changed ... at any rate something goes a little awry if you have old files in there. Did not test whether this includes both the .o and the .dll or just one of them: I just delete.
