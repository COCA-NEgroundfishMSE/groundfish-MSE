#### Debugging ####

# Debug using simple temperature trend that reduces variance? (T/F)
simpleTemperature <- FALSE


# Which management procedures csv do you want to read:
#mprocfile<-"mproc.csv"
#mprocfile<-"mprocTest.csv"
#mprocfile<-"mprocEcon.csv"
mprocfile<-"mprocEconT.csv"

#### Stock parameters ####

# If you have files in the modelParameters folder for stocks but you don't
# want to include them in a run you can write them in here in the
# stockExclude variable. Do not include the extension.R. For example,
# stockExclude <- 'haddockGB' (string) will leave haddockGB.R out of the analysis.
# stockExclude <- NULL indludes all stocks.
# Available stocks: haddockGB, codGOM, codGB, pollock, yellowtailflounderGB
#stockExclude <- c('haddockGB', 'codGOM','codGB', 'pollock','yellowtailflounderGB')
stockExclude<-NULL
stockExclude <- c('yellowtailflounderGB')
#### historic assessment values #### AEW
# if you want to use an input of historic assessment data
# just fishing mortality for now

#### Structural parameters ####

# number of times to repeat this analysis
nrep <- 50

# First year to begin actual management
fmyear <- 2019

# first year after the initial condition period. The initial condition period
# simply fills up the arrays as necessary even before the burn-in period
# begins. This is rather arbitrary but should be larger than the number of
# years in the assessment model and greater than the first age in the model.
fyear <- 38

# maximum year predicted into the future
mxyear <- 2040

#### Burn-in parameters ####

# number of burn-in years (before the pre-2000 non-assessment period)
nburn <- 50


#### Temperature information ####

## Do you want to include temperature projections (in S-R, growth, etc.)
useTemp <- TRUE

## Do you want to use particular models from the cmip data series? If so
## tmods should be a vector of column names (see
## data/data_raw/NEUS_CMIP5_annual_meansLong.csv'). If NULL use all data
tmods <- NULL

## The temperature quantile of the cmip data series to use. 0.5 for median.
tq <- 0.5

## Representative concentration pathway to use. Currently only 8.5 available.
trcp <- 8.5

## Reference years for temperature downscale
ref0 <- 1982
ref1 <- 2020

## Reference year and function for anomaly calculation
baseTempYear <- 1985
anomFun <- median

# Number of model years to run are defined by the length of the burn-in
# period and the dimension of the CMIP5 data set.
# Load the cmip5 temperature data
# cmip5 <- read.table(file='data/data_raw/NEUS_CMIP5_annual_means.txt',
#                     header=TRUE, skip=2)
# cmip5 <- subset(cmip5, year <= mxyear)

# nyear <- nrow(cmip5) + nburn

#### Management ####

# Scalars to relate the calculated values of reference points to the
# threshold values. Typically this will be 1/2 for Bmsy and 0.75 for F but
# these can be changed to examine sensitivity.
BrefScalar <- 0.5
FrefScalar <- 0.75
