SSBR at F=0 was not available in stock assessment model outputs. Most of the information for RP calculations was given in the tables in the draft Haddock 2017 update assessment, but it lacked the fraction of fishing/natural mortality prior to spawning. I did a quick search and when I set both of those to 0.25 I got answers for F40%, YPR and SSBR that were very close to those reported in the table as YPR output.  SSBR at F=0 was 4.50.
