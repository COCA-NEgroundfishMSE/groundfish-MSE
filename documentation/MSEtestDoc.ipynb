    "**1\\. Introduction**  \n",
    "The objective of the management strategy evaluation is to determine what regulatory procedures may be the most effective given the dynamics of the population and fishery and especially considering expected environmental trends related to climate change.  Recruitment, growth, mortality and the assessment-management procedure process are modeled together so that the feedback from the management strategies on the population can be quantified.\n",
    "The management components included were the stock assessment model, calculation of any necessary biological reference points for the management procedure and the harvest control rule.  Some of the management procedure components had the capacity to incorporate the types of environmental changes that were built into the simulations.\n",
    "The model can only approximate the order and timing of events in the population and management complex.  Recruitment occurs instantaneously at the beginning of each year, immediately followed by instantaneous growth.  Fishing and natural mortality then operate through the rest of the year from Jan 1 â€“ Dec 31.  Management (i.e., assessment and regulation-setting) occurs instantaneously at the end of the year and rules (i.e., fishing mortality in the next year) are implemented on Jan 1 with no lag time.\n",

    "![Figure 1. Schematic of operating model.  Population processes growth and recruitment occur instantaneously at the beginning of the year while mortality occurs continuously throughout the year.  Temperature has the potential to impact each of the population processes and to be built directly into the management procedures. ](images/flow.jpg)\n",

Currently temperature is not built into this function but this is planned and is why $L_{a,y}$ has the subscript $y$ (i.e., temperature will change by year, meaning that length-at-age is a dynamic quantity).\n",

    "**2\\.4 Recruitment**  \n",
    "Recruitment is a central component of the MSE because it is directly affected by temperature.  In addition, stock recruitment relationships are notoriously difficult to measure.  Given the significance associated with this central model component it is important to ensure that both model expected values and various uncertainties are accounted for.  \n",
