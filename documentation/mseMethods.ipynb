    "**Description of the management strategy evaluation framework for New England groundfish**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1\\. Introduction**  \n",
    "Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a general framework aimed at simulation testing management procedures (MPs). This model framework involves simulating the natural and human aspects of the managed fishery resource system under different circumstances and evaluating performance based on management objectives. A key advantage of the approach is that the operating model (OM) provides a representation of ‘true’ population dynamics and a baseline for comparison of performance across estimation approaches and alternative MPs. MSE can identify the performance of an existing MP and can allow for comparisons across alternative MPs based on metrics that reflect management objectives. Additionally, trade-offs among management objectives achieved by different HCRs can be evaluated while explicitly accounting for uncertainty (Dichmont et al., 2008). This approach is valuable for identifying MPs that are robust to natural variation in the system and to uncertainty and error, both in stock assessments (e.g., retrospective patterns) and implementation (ICES, 2020).\n",
     "\n",
     "The OMs for groundfish stocks in this framework are single species, stochastic, age-structured models designed to emulate population dynamics. Recruitment, growth, mortality and the assessment-management procedure process are modeled together so that the feedback from the management strategies on the population can be quantified.\n",
    "The management components included are the stock assessment model, calculation of any necessary biological reference points for the management procedure, projections for catch advice, and the harvest control rule.  Some of the management procedure components have the capacity to incorporate the types of environmental changes that are built into the simulations.\n",
    "The model can only approximate the order and timing of events in the population and management complex. Recruitment occurs instantaneously at the beginning of each year, immediately followed by instantaneous growth. Fishing and natural mortality then operate through the rest of the year from Jan 1 – Dec 31. Management (i.e., assessment and regulation-setting) occurs at the end of the year and rules (i.e., fishing mortality in the next year) are implemented on Jan 1. There is an option to incorporate a lag in information to the stock assessment. With the lag, the simulation process was designed to be consistent with current New England groundfish management whereby the stock assessment performed in year t has a terminal year of t-1, and the resulting catch advice is for year t+1 and greater depending on the stock assessment frequency. \n",
    "Note that this MSE approach is not a full MSE until management objectives are identified and prioritized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1. Schematic of operating model.  Population processes growth and recruitment occur instantaneously at the beginning of the year while mortality occurs continuously throughout the year.  Temperature has the potential to impact each of the population processes and to be built directly into the management procedures. If desired, historical trajectories can be reconstructed by incorporating recruitment and F time series from the most recent stock assessments and calculating SSB and catch as emergent properties.  ](./images/flow.jpg)\n",

Recruitment is specified either as a constant value that is a function (e.g., the mean) of stock assessment model output or as a function of the available spawner biomass (and possibly temperature if that functionality is switched on). Potential values for $F$ run from 0 to 2.0 and the total yield (catch biomass) in each year is saved. $F_{MSY}$ is specified as the value from the $F$ grid that results in the maximum total yield.\n",

    "The aim of this HCR option is to avoid overfishing by accounting for scientific uncertainty with a probabilistic approach. In this scenario, the P* approach (Prager & Shertzer, 2010) was used to derive target catch. The P* method derives target catch as a low percentile of projected catch at the OFL. The distribution of the catch at the OFL was assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with a CV of 1 (Wiedenmann et al., 2016). The target catch corresponds to a probability of overfishing no higher than 50% (P*<0.5) in accordance with the National Standard 1 guidelines. The level of P* depends on the level of SSB. This alternative emulats HCRs used in the Council’s Small Mesh Multispecies FMP.\n",

If the SSB never decreased below the biomass threshold or increased to over SSBMSY (rebuilt) after dropping below the biomass threshold, this HCR used a target F of 75% FMSY. National Standard Guidelines were amended in 2016. These revisions reduced the need to identify an incidental bycatch ABC and indicated that Frebuild need not be recalculated after every assessment, making it less likely that Frebuild will be set to zero in response to short-term lags in rebuilding.\n",

   "**6.3.8 Constrained ramp harvest control rule**  \n",
    "The aim of this HCR alternative was to promote rebuilding, optimal yield, and to provide catch stability if stock biomass were to substantially change from year to year. Stable catch was identified as an objective in the Council’s risk policy (NEFMC, 2016). This differs from the ramp HCR in that there was a constraint on variation in target catch from year to year, meaning that the current year’s catch limit will not change more than 20% from the previous year’s catch limit. The threshold of 20% change in catch is in the middle of the range of change in catch thresholds used in HCRs in other fisheries. Catch is constrained so that it was not higher than the perceived OFL. \n",

    "**6.4 Projections**  \n",
    "Projections can be turned on or off. If projections are on, catch advice is generated from projected catch with F determined from the HCR. There are 100 iterations for each projection which incorporates uncertainty in recruitment and the initial abundance derived from the last year of the stock assessment. If there is a lag in the stock assessment information, a ‘bridge’ year is projected to estimate abundance at the beginning of the following year. Initial abundance is drawn from a lognormal distribution with a mean of the final abundance estimate and a standard deviation corresponding to the standard deviations of the total abundance estimates from the most recent stock assessment conducted by the NEFSC. This approach is used in this study because the MSE framework does not use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach to estimate uncertainty in the stock assessment models due to computational constraints. For NEFSC stock assessments, a MCMC approach provides multiple realizations of numbers at age that can be used in the projections. F from the previous iteration of the HCR, or the F from the previous year’s catch advice, is used in the ‘bridge year’ to calculate total mortality. Projections are currently used in determining catch advice for almost all New England groundfish with analytical assessments. If there is a lag in information to the stock assessment, stock assessment outputs with a terminal year of t-1 are used in projections at year t to estimate catch advice for year t+1 and year t+2. If there is no lag in information to the stock assessment, stock assessment outputs with a terminal year of t are used in projections to estimate catch advice for year t+1 and year t+2. With no lag in information to the stock assessment, the projections do not have a 'bridge' year.\n",
