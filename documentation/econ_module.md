<br> Describes the code that implements the "Economic Simulation Module" in the management strategy evaluation

***
### Status
The code runs, but is missing a few things. "runSim.R" runs, but will take a while to run. 


### Statistics Behind the Economic simulation module
The population of vessels in the statistical model is: "Vessels that landed groundfish in the 2004-2015 time period, primarily used gillnet or trawl to catch groundfish, elected to fish in the sector program in 2010-2015, and were not falsifying their catch or sales records."  $i$ indexes individuals, $n$ indexes target, and $t$ indexes time (days).

The statistical economic module has two stages. In the first stage, we estimate a Schaefer's harvest equation   
	\begin{equation}
	H_{nit}=h(q_{ni},E_{nit},{X_{it})
	\end{equation}
This is estimated equation-by-equation with ordinary least squares, using a log-log functional form.
	\begin{equation}
	log H_{nit}= log q + b logE + clog X + e
	\end{equation}
although there are more than just these 3 explanatory variables.

Catchability $q$ varies by vessel-target.  The results are used to predict expected harvest of target $n$. These are then adjusted to account for the jointness in catching fish. For example, a trip that is targeting GB cod and that lands 1000 lbs of GB cod is also likely to land 500 lb of GB haddock, 200 lb of pollock, and 80 lb of skates.  We track all these and multiply by expected prices to construct expected revenue for vessel $i$'s trip that targets GB cod on day $t$. We repeat for all $i$,$n$, $t$ to construct expected revenue for all feasible choices.

In the second stage, we estimate the probability that a vessel will target "thing" t: 
\begin{equation}
P[Target_{nit}] =P(Revenues_{nit}, Costs_{nit}, Z_{nit})
\end{equation}
We observe whether the vessel actually targeted a thing or did not. These statistical models are referred to as discrete-, binary-, or multinomial- choice models.  The theoretical model underneath this is a Random Utility Model.  Currently, we're using an Alternative-specific Conditional Logit, but we're exploring other options, including nested and mixed logits. Estimation of the asc logit is by maximum likelihood (or quasi-ML, can't remember).

We can simulate either the production or targeting equations at any values of the explanatory variables: for example changes in the trawl survey (used as a biomass proxy) can affect changes in harvest, which feeds into expected revenue and eventually the target equation.  Changes in costs or weather would directly affect the targeting equation. 

We can also simulate what happens when a fishery (GOM Cod, Pollock, Skates) are closed -- how does fishing effort redistribute to other targets?

For both the production and targeting models, the unit of observation is a permit-day.

The statistical estimation of the model takes place externally to the MSE model -- there isn't a need to have this occur simultaneously (yet).

### The R code
There's a pile of code. It's quite janky.
There are few files in "scratch/econscratch" that may be useful
* **test_predict_etargeting_and_production.R :** was used to verify that the predict_etargeting.R and predict_eproduction.R functions works properly. It runs as a standalone and might be fun to explore. 

* **working_econ_module.R :**  is a *working* economic module. The last part is kinda janky, but should just about close the bio$\rightarrow$ econ $\rightarrow$ bio loop.  Currently does not do the catch multipliers. 

* **test_econ_module.R :**  is a test economic module. The last part is incredibly janky, but should just about close the bio$\rightarrow$ econ $\rightarrow$ bio loop. I'm just waiting to have runSim.R reordered before I can use it to write out F_full to stock[[i]] for the modeled stocks.  Pieces of this will be put into fragments that are called by "runSetup.R" (perhaps with an if cut-out for EconomicModel) because they only need to be run once.  Other parts should be converted into a function or many functions.

* **speedups_econ_module2.R :**  code for benchmarking the economic model.
 
There are  "processes" files: 
* **genBaselineACLs.R:** This is used to construct "baseline" ACLs for the non-modeled stocks. That includes Groundfish *and* non-groundfish stocks like lobster or skate that either caught with groundfish or altenatives to taking a groundfish trip.

* **genEcon_Containers.R:** Gets called in the runSetup.R file. It sets up a few placeholders for Fleet level economic outputs.

Functions:
* **predict_eproduction:** Predicts harvest of the target species, returns a data.table

* **predict_etargeting:** predicts targeting, returns a data.table.

* **get_bio_for_econ:** passes *things* from the biological model (in stock[[i]]) to the economic model.

* **get_best_trip:** for each vessel-day (id) selects the choice (spstock2) with the highest prhat

* **get_random_draw_tripsDT:** for each vessel-day (id) randomly selects a choice (spstock2) based on prhat. Reworked to  data.table

* **get_fishery_next_period:** adds up catch from individual vessels to the daily level and then aggregates with prior catch.  Checks if the sector sub-ACL is reached and closes the fishery if so.

* **get_fishery_next_period:** adds up catch from individual vessels to the daily level and then aggregates with prior catch.  Checks if the sector sub-ACL is reached and closes the fishery if so.  For the allocated multispecie stocks, this creates and extrac column that indicates if that stockarea is closed.


* **zero_out_closed_asc_cutout:** Closes a fishery and redistributes the probability associated with that stock to the other options. This is based on the "underACL" logical column.   Skips math if all stocks are open.

* **zero_out_closed_areas_asc_cutout:** Closes a fishery and redistributes the probability associated with that stock to the other options.  This is based on the "stockarea_open" logical column.   Skips math if all stocks are open




Obsolete
These are obsolete and have been moved to /scratch/econscratch/obsolete
* **get_at_age_stats, get_catch_at_age, get_e_smear, test_get_at_age_stats, test_get_catch_at_age, test_predict_eproduction:** all probably are obsolete and have been moved to /scratch/econscratch/obsolete.
* **get_random_draw_trips:** for each vessel-day (id) randomly selects a choice (spstock2) based on prhat
There are a few files in "/preprocessing/economic/"  These primarily deal with converting data from stata format to RData and making the estimated coefficients "line up" with the data.  There is also a helper file to wrangle the historical catch limit and catch data.   
* **zero_out_closed_asc:** Closes a fishery and redistributes the probability associated with that stock to the other options.
* **speed_asclogit:** Speed testing for an asc logit.

* **predict_eproductionCpp:** A version that uses RCpp sugar. This wasn't faster than base R.  I think this is because each "day" is a relatively small dataset.  Predicts harvest of the target species, returns a data.table

* **predict_etargetingCpp:** A version that uses RCpp sugar. This wasn't faster than base R.  Predicts targeting, returns a data.table.


### Inputs,
Data, starting values and parameter bounds are XXX.

Running the model requires
/data/data_processed/econ/full_production.RData, /data/data_processed/econ/full_targeting.RData, and /data/data_processed/econ/catch_limits_2010_2017.csv

I should probably write up a small file or parameters.
  * which gffishingyear


### Outputs
Model outputs are XXX


### To do and known bugs
* **zero_out_closed_asc:** currently only closes a target when it's ACL is reached. It should close all fisheries that would be caught with it. For example, if GB Cod quotas are hit, then *all* multispecies GB fishing stops. It also must adjust the landings and (probably catch) multipliers -- if a vessel targets skates after the GB Cod quota is hit, it should not land any GB cod. Whether it can catch GB cod is TBD.

* **working_econ_module.R :** 
  * Needs to be cleaned up.  Tidyverse version uses 6GB of RAM in a single simulation. Doesn't look like I have a leak, just using lots of memory.  data.table version is down to ~4.4GB. data.table version back up to 6+gb
  * Needs to be sped up.  data.table instead of seems to speed up?  Tidyverse version takes 16 minutes to run 1 replicated for 20 years (48sec/yr).  The data.table version takes 22-23 to run 2 replicates for 20 years (33 sec/yr).  approx 31% faster. Down to 18-20seconds/yr (depending on how often fisheries are closed.
  * Does not yet incorporate catch/landings multipliers. So that's a big problem.  Will need to add the multiplier data, code to integrate, test, and adjust.
  * Doesn't read/use IJ1 trawl survey index(biomass index computed on Jan 1).
  * does not store fishery revenue anywhere, just overwrites it.
  * slowest parts are eproduction, etargeting, and randomdraw.
  
### Notes
* packages are gmm, mvtnorm, tmvtnorm, expm, msm, Matrix, TMB, forcats, readr, tidyverse, dplyr, data.table
* the targeting and production datasets now conform. Production dataset is not necessary.

 * The Econ module is a little bit fragile.  A few datasets need to be merged *during* the simulation. I initially used "base::merge."   That was slow, so I used "dplyr::left_join," which was faster.  Now, I'm ensuring that the merged datasets are the same length and order and using "cbind."
    * There is a left_join in zero_out_closed_asc_cutout.R. I don't think I can avoid this.
* I've verified that the functions are working, but I *think* there is an underlying data error.
