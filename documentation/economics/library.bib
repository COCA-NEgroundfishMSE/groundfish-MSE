SNF Working Paper No. 37/05 2 ABSTRACT During the last decades, there has been virtually an explosion in the number of studies of the demand structure for seafood markets. The most common approach is demand analysis, where demand equations are estimated either individually or in a system of demand equations. These studies of the demand structure focus on the price sensitivity of demand, on the degree of substitution between potentially competing products and on income/expenditure effects. However, as price information is often more available than quantity, there have been a number of market integration studies that primarily focus on the competition between different products. The purpose of this paper is to give a review of demand and market integration studies with respect to fish, focusing on the method used, the information that is obtained, and how this information varies with the approach used.},

Supply to a daily fish market is determined by the previous night's catch; hence this would appear to be a good example of a recursive market. Despite this, data from the Fulton fish market are treated in the literature, without adequate explanation, as coming from a market in which price and quantity are determined simultaneously. We provide the missing explanation, and in doing so reveal some issues about simultaneity that deserve better coverage in our textbooks and fuller consideration by applied econometricians. {\textcopyright} 2010 EEA.},

abstract = {A key issue in the estimation of production functions is the correlation between unobservable productivity shocks and input levels. Profit-maximizing firms respond to positive productivity shocks by expanding output, which requires additional inputs. Negative shocks lead firms to pare back output, decreasing their input usage. Olley and Pakes (1996) develop an estimator that uses investment as a proxy for these unobservable shocks. More recently, Levinsohn and Petrin (2003a) introduce an estimator that uses intermediate inputs as proxies, arguing that intermediates may respond more smoothly to productivity shocks. This paper reviews Levinsohn and Petrin's approach and introduces a Stata command that implements it.},

This article utilizes facility-level, cost-earnings data on shoreside processors in the Pacific whiting fishery to describe behavior before and after rationalization in 2011, where 20{\%} of the harvesting quota was allocated to processors. Predicted effects on processors centered on the potential for season lengthening to lead to increased ex-vessel prices and efficiency gains in the use of processing inputs, like labor and utilities. Data show longer seasons following rationalization, with processors paying higher ex-vessel prices as the ratio of ex-vessel to export prices fell. Estimated changes in efficiency match predictions directionally, but are not statistically significant, which may be due, in part, to the limited number of facilities and the range of other factors from which the impacts of rationalization must be disentangled.},

We show that using Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) is a good practice compared to other approximate solutions. We then introduce a new complementary solution to deal with zeros consisting in adding a positive value specific to each observation that avoids some numerical issues faced by the former.},

abstract = {To understand price changes, one must determine the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price. Conditional on predetermined supply and demand elasticities, we retrieve yearly shifts in regional supply and demand. The relative impact on price from each supply and demand shift is determined through an equilibrium displacement model (EDM). This procedure is applied on a yearly basis for the world salmon market in the period 2002 to 2011. The results indicate a large variation in demand and supply growth both over time and between regions. While average annual price impacts from supply or demand shifts from most regions are not statistically significant, price impacts from supply or demand shifts for specific periods are detected in all but one region. This indicates that the use of smooth trend indicators is likely to be inappropriate for measuring supply and demand shifts and their impacts on price. The procedure presented in this article can be a useful instrument for determining the relative impacts of supply and demand shifts on price in any market with unstable price behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2014, Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether the underlying regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard F- and t-statistics used to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibrium correction mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null hypothesis that there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I0 or I1. Two sets of asymptotic critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I1 and the other if they are all purely I0. These two sets of critical values provide a band covering all possible classifications of the regressors into purely I0, purely I1 or mutually cointegrated. Accordingly, various bounds testing procedures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed tests are consistent, and their asymptotic distribution under the null and suitably defined local alternatives are derived. The empirical relevance of the bounds procedures is demonstrated by a re-examination of the earnings equation included in the UK Treasury macroeconometric model.},

abstract = {Differentiated products are the central economic focus of competition in consumer goods products such as cereal, soda, and beer. We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff{\'{e}}renciation des produits est un aspect {\'{e}}conomique central de la concurrence sur les march{\'{e}}s des biens de consommations comme les c{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}ales, les sodas ou les bi{\`{e}}res.

abstract = {Can a perishable food commodity with strong seasonal variation in supply, supplied by producers with limited operational radius, belong to a spatially integrated market? The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods.},

In this paper, the duration of trade relationships for Norwegian export firms to various markets is investigated for six product forms of one commodity, cod. The results indicate that the duration of most trade relationships is very short, and shorter than what is normally reported in the literature. Still, the substantial variation in duration by product form and factors influencing it, indicates heterogeneous dynamics for each supply chain even for slight differences in the characteristics of a commodity. Moreover, the short duration of trade relationships in the supply chains for Norwegian cod indicates that they remain very traditional food supply chains, with few attempts at reducing transaction costs through vertical coordination or relationships.},

A simple theoretical model is used to demonstrate that current industry returns may he low or even negative during this adjustment phase. A case in point is the New Zealand commercial fisheries which have re- cently become subject to a Quota Management System. Three sources of evidence on the level of resource rents generated during the initial years of the Quota Management System are examined and compared. These sources are: annual profitability data; the market price of perpetual quota; and the market price of annual lease quota. The evidence in some cases appears to be con- tradictory and an attempt is made to resolve or explain such differences. It is concluded that a better understanding of price determination in the quota market is required in order to draw correct inferences about rent generation.},

This review surveys a wide range of empirical experiences in different contexts around the world to help provide a fuller picture of potential and sometimes disparate consequences from privatization in general and new ways of organizing around fishing that can follow in the wake of such measures. Looking at the many different participants in the fishing industry-from crew, small-boat owners, to households and communities-as well as the diverse sociocultural contexts in which fishing takes place, enables a better understanding of who and what is impacted, how they are impacted, why and with what further consequences, such that communities come to be seen less oppositional to economy, but rather constituted by multiple scalar processes and by economic relations comprising different motivations and behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Multi-input multi-output production technolo- gies can be represented using distance functions. Econo- metric estimation of these functions typically involves factoring out one of the outputs or inputs and estimating the resulting equation using maximum likelihood methods. A problem with this approach is that the outputs or inputs that are not factored out may be correlated with the composite error term. Fernandez et al. (J Econ 98:47–79, 2000) show how to solve this so-called ‘endogeneity problem' using Bayesian methods. In this paper I use the approach to estimate an output distance function and an associated index of total factor productivity (TFP) change. The TFP index is a new index that satisfies most, if not all, eco- nomically-relevant axioms from index number theory. It can also be exhaustively decomposed into a measure of technical change and various measures of efficiency change. I illustrate the methodology using state-level data on U.S. agricultural input and output quantities (no prices are needed). Results are summarized in terms of the characteristics (e.g., means) of estimated probability den- sity functions for measures of TFP change, technical change and efficiency change. Keywords},

Tests for the presence of an intercept or linear trend in the cointegrating relations are also developed together with model misspecification tests. Secondly, efficient estimation of vector error correction models when the short-run dynamics may differ within and between equations is considered.

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of the bootstrap for the most commonly applied procedures in inequality, mobility and poverty measurement. In addition to simple inequality index estimation the scenarios considered are inequality difference tests for correlated data, decompositions by sub-group or income source, decompositions of inequality changes, and mobility index and poverty index estimation. Besides showing the consistency of the bootstrap for these scenarios, the paper also develops simple ways to deal with longitudinal correlation and panel attrition or non-response. In principle, all the proposed procedures can be handled by the $\delta$-method, but Monte Carlo evidence suggests that the simplest possible bootstrap procedure should be the preferred method in practice, as it achieves the same accuracy as the $\delta$-method and takes into account the stochastic dependencies in the data without explicitly having to deal with its covariance structure. If a variance estimate is available, then the studentized version of the bootstrap may lead to an improvement in accuracy, but substantially so only for relatively small sample sizes. All results incorporate the possibility that different observations have different sampling weights. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

An alternative approach based on poisson approximation can be theoretically consistent with RUM while permitting specification of a choice set of almost unlimited spatial detail. Exten-sion to nested and mixed logit models is straightforward. An application of the approach to spatial valuation of the North Pacific groundfish fishery shows that it can produce nearly identical results to those achieved by a conventional logit model. Although harvests are spread over a wide geographic extent, estimated short-run fishery value densities are highly concentrated in a few relatively small regions.},

Training programmes are associated medium-term impacts, although in the short term they often appear ineffective. We a outcome variable used to measure programme impact matters, but neither the publicat study nor the use of a randomised design is related to the sign or significance of t estimate. The effectiveness of active labour market policies -including subsidised employment, training and job search assistance -has been a matter of vigorous debate over the pas half century.1 While many aspects of the debate remain unsettled, some progress has been made on the key question of how participation in an active labour market programme (ALMP) affects the labour market outcomes of the participants them-selves.2 Progress has been facilitated by rapid advances in methodology and dat quality, and by a growing institutional commitment to evaluation in many countries, and has resulted in an explosion of professionally authored microeconometric evalu-ations.

The results indicate that Japanese investors prefer states with strong markets and low unionization rates.  The influence of taxation is mixed, although state unitary tax methods, which were strongly opposed by Japanese companies, are found to be a significant deterrent to new start-ups.  The early establishment of a Japanese office for trade and investment is significant as well.  At the substate level, there appears to be a tendency to avoid less-developed areas of the country.  Instead, Japanese manufacturing plants are more likely to select counties characterized by manufacturing agglomeration, low unemployment and poverty rates, and concentrations of educated, productive workers.  In the automotive corridor, Japanese manufacturers avoid counties with high black population densities and high unemployment areas and are less oriented toward urban sites than elsewhere in the US.},

abstract = {Using a model of regulated open access resource use with markets, we illustrate the potential complexity of interactions between markets, product quality, excess effort, and regulatory behavior in fisheries. Our model assumes two product types, one of which is processed and storable. The model describes the equilibrium that results when effort responds to open access incentives and when regulators respond to effort growth by mitigating its potential harmful effects on biomass safety. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate a mechanism by which market growth leads to the diversion of raw inputs into the inherently inferior market. The result is a scenario in which rents are dissipated not only because excessive inputs raise costs, but also because inferior product types reduce revenues. We conclude with an illustrative decomposition of rent gains into revenue and cost savings gains from rationalizing a hypothetical fishery, demonstrating the potential significance of market-side rents. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Responsive harvest control rules provide inherent resilience to adverse effects of climate change and scientific uncertainty.-ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsz038. Climate change is altering marine ecosystem and fish stock dynamics worldwide. These effects add to scientific uncertainties that compromise fisheries management. Among the strategies that can respond to climate change and scientific uncertainty, modifications to harvest control rules (HCRs) might be among the most direct and impactful. We used a bioeconomic model to compare alternative HCRs in terms of bio-mass, yield, and profits in response to potential effects of climate change and scientific uncertainty, specifically simulated retrospective patterns , for 14 stocks on the Northeast Shelf of the United States. Our results suggest that a responsive HCR in which fishing mortality changes with measured changes in biomass builds inherent resilience to adverse effects of both climate change and scientific uncertainty relative to an HCR in which fishing mortality is precautionary but fixed. This was despite that fact that the HCR algorithm did not account for the climate effects modelled. A fixed fishing mortality HCR was effective when climate effects were negligible or beneficial. Scientific uncertainty further reduced biomass, yield, and profits by about the same magnitude as climate change. Our results suggest that simple changes to HCRs can be a readily implementable strategy for responding to climate change and scientific uncertainty.},

Policy supporters assert that resulting markets raise conservation incentives. In compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, species assessments permit catch shares to replace more spatially and temporally specific constraints on fishing gear, time, areas, and daily harvest limits. Qualitative evidence from field interviews and participant observation questions the efficacy of catch shares. Fishing industry members observe that increased presence of large trawl vessels in previously protected areas damages fish subpopulations and benthic habitat. Regulatory bioeconomic models fail to consider these lay observations.

abstract = {Anticipating fisher behaviour is necessary for successful fisheries management. Of the different concepts that have been developed to understand individual fisher behaviour, random utility models (RUMs) have attracted considerable attention in the past three decades, and more particularly so since the 2000s. This study aimed at summarizing and analysing the information gathered from RUMs used during the last three decades around the globe. A methodology has been developed to standardize information across different studies and compare RUM results. The studies selected focused on fishing effort allocation. Six types of fisher behaviour drivers were considered: the presence of other vessels in the same fishing area, tra-dition, expected revenue, species targeting, costs, and risk-taking. Analyses were performed using three separate linear modelling approaches to assess the extent to which these different drivers impacted fisher behaviour in three fleet types: fleets fishing for demersal species using active gears, fleets fishing for demersal species using passive gears and fleets fishing for pelagic species. Fishers are attracted by higher expected revenue, tradition, species targeting and presence of others, but avoid choices involving large costs. Results also suggest that fishers fishing for demersal species using active gears are generally more influenced by past seasonal (long-term) patterns than by the most recent (short-term) information. Finally, the comparison of expected revenue with other fisher behaviour drivers highlights that demersal fishing vessels are risk-averse and that tradition and species targeting influence fisher decisions more than expected revenue.},

The results help identify the level of price risk found within the aquaculture industry across species and products. In addition, we differentiate between technologies comparing wild-caught fish with aquaculture products. The results also help us consider the relative riskiness of aquaculture compared to other industries. The results indicate that in aggregate, price volatility for aquacultured products is substantially lower than for wild. However, this varies substantially between species. {\textcopyright} 2015, Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Since the publication of Rosen's " Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets " , property value hedonics has become the workhorse model for valuing local public goods and amenities, despite a number of well-known and well-documented econometric problems. For example, Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) each describe a source of endogeneity in the second stage of Rosen's two-step procedure that has proven difficult to overcome using standard econometric arguments. This problem has led researchers to avoid estimat-ing marginal willingness-to-pay functions altogether, relying instead on the first-stage hedonic price function, which can only be used to value marginal changes. In this pa-per, we propose a new econometric approach to recover the marginal willingness-to-pay function that avoids these endogeneity problems. With a parametric specification for the marginal willingness-to-pay function, our approach is both computationally light and easy to implement. We apply this estimator to data on large changes in violent crime rates in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Results indicate that marginal willingness to pay increases by between twenty to thirty cents with each additional case of violent crime per 100,000 residents, suggesting that simply using the first-stage hedonic price function to value non-marginal reductions in crime (like those that occurred during the 1990s) may lead to severely biased estimates of welfare.},

abstract = {In the last decade, various spatial and temporal methodologies were developed to investigate the processes that drive ecological and evolutionary patterns. However, these methods frequently fail to acknowledge that the observed patterns result from the overlap of different underlying processes. In order to understand how the patterns are formed, we must have recourse to methods that allow us to disentangle these simultaneous processes. Here we develop a hierarchical spatial predictive process (PP) combined with a separable temporal PP to disentangle and describe those overlapping processes in one very frequent setting in ecology and evolution: multilevel spatio-temporally indexed data. We present our methodology through a case study of fisheries discards and investigate for example whether the inclusion of the hierarchical structure and the temporal processes of the system alter the observed spatial patterns. Recently it is recognized that understanding the processes driving discards is essential to sustainably manage and conserve marine resources. The results show that consideration of multiple underlying processes dramatically changes the pattern and characteristics of the discards hot- and coldspots. In the Irish Sea, the inclusion of the hierarchical structure of the system leads to the reduction of the hot- and coldspots. Simultaneously, our model identifies key bi-annual fluctuations in the temporal process which, together with the variance associated at the level of individual fishing trips in the hierarchical structure of the data explained most of the variance driving discards. Whether the hierarchical, spatial and temporal processes are considered together or not can profoundly alter our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate mitigation measure. Misidentification of hotspots can culminate in inappropriate mitigation practices which can sometimes be irreversible. As the proposed method offers a unified approach for understanding the processes that drive observed patterns, many areas in ecology such as conservation and epidemiological studies can benefit from its use, increasing the effectiveness of management plans.},

The application of the decomposition to Australia reveals that the direct effect of tax-transfer policy reforms accounts for half of the observed increase in income inequality between 1999 and 2008, while the increased dispersion of wages and capital incomes also played an important role.},

abstract = {Recent work in ecology emphasized the spa-tial patchiness of marine resources. Fish and shellfish populations often occur in clumps or discrete patches of habitat with differ-ent population levels and dynamics in each patch. Patches are linked through a set of complex biological and oceanographic fac-tors. This new view has given rise to spatial marine management proposals, including per-manent marine reserves and rotating spatial closures. Reserve proposals are particularly popular among ecologists because closed areas can presumably augment the biomass in areas that were overharvested due to stochas-tic shocks or poor management practices. Little is known, however, about how indi-vidual harvesters would respond to spatial management. Economists can contribute sub-stantially to debates about spatial policies by building models that explain spatial behavior of commercial fishers.! Beliefs about profitability of different loca-tions are the most important determinants of location choice for commercial fishing, but they are unobservable. Differences in prof-itability are driven, in part, by the spatial het-erogeneity of the resource. In many fisheries, individual harvesters make discrete location choices across space on a daily basis. This paper addresses the connections that bridge fishers' observed data, the beliefs that the fishers formulate, and the resulting location choice behavior. The crux of the modeling problem is that we, as analysts, observe indi-vidual discrete choices and we observe the location-specific catch and revenue histories of individuals (information or data), and yet we do not really know how individuals pro-cess their data into beliefs. In these circum-stances, is it possible to make inferences simultaneously about behavioral responsive-ness and information processing? Can we use behavioral models to test hypotheses about search behavior? Is it possible to determine both how harvesters share information and how this sharing affects behavior? To address these questions, this paper looks at three aspects of information processing: the choice between structural and reduced-form models, information decay, and complexities of spa-tial search and information sharing.},

abstract = {The absence of property rights leads to dissipation of resource rents in fisheries. Economists have long recommended the assignment of property rights to the fishery as a means to internalize the stock externalities that lead to rent dissipation. However, ; there is less agreement and little research on the opti-mal nature of property rights for fisheries. Sole ownership of the fishery, while potentially efficient , is generally not politically acceptable. Individual transfer-able quota (ITQ) systems may fail to achieve an efficient outcome for a variety of reasons, many of which are related to spatial phenomena. Territorial user rights in fisheries (TURFs), also will generally fail to achieve efficient out-comes. This paper illustrates a number of cases where inefficiency may persist in a rights-based fishery management system. Some of the potential benefits and costs of territorial stock use rights in fisheries (T-SURFs) are discussed along with the role of marine zoning.},

abstract = {This paper describes a simulation study that evaluated the performance of the scientific advisory process used by ICES to recommend total allowable catches (TACs) for roundfish stocks. A "management strategy evaluation" approach is used, involving development of an operating model to represent the underlying reality, and an observation model to generate pseudo data that are then used within a management procedure. The management procedure comprises an assessment that uses data to estimate parameters of interest and a decision rule to derive TAC recommendations for the following year. There are two important results: including realistic sources and levels of uncertainty can result in far from optimal management outcomes based on the current procedures; and current ICES biomass and fishing mortality reference points are not always consistent, and several are clearly inappropriate. This is because the types of projection used by ICES do not incorporate important lags between assessing stock status and implementing management measures, and they also ignore important sources of uncertainty about the actual dynamics, as well as our ability to collect data and implement management regulations (i.e. model, measurement, and implementation error, respectively). The simulation approach also showed that better management is not necessarily going to be achieved by improving the assessment, because even with a perfect assessment (where the simulated working group knew stock status perfectly), stocks may crash at fishing levels that standard stochastic projections would suggest were safe. It is proposed that, in future, operating models that represent the best available understanding of the actual system dynamics be used to evaluate models and rules considered for application. These operating models should capture the plausible range of characteristics of the underlying dynamics, but not necessarily model their full complexity. In general, they will be more complex than those used by assessment working groups, so developing management procedures that are robust to a broad range of uncertainty. However, the models and rules used as part of the management procedure should be simpler than those used at present.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Crown copyright. Journal of Fish Biology published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd on behalf of Fisheries Society of the British Isles. The concept of an optimum yield at intermediate levels of fishing (the so called maximum sustainable yield or MSY) has been with us since the 1930s and is now enshrined in legislation as a key objective of fisheries management. The concept seems intuitively reasonable and is readily applicable to a single stock treated in isolation and assuming a constant environment. However, translating this concept into a mixed and multispecies fishery, where there are complex trade-offs between fleets and stocks and in general no simple optimum solution, has been problematic. Here I introduce a framework for thinking about multispecies MSY in terms of an integrated risk of stock depletion and expected long-term yield. Within this framework I consider the performance of a set of simple harvest control rules based upon a single-limit fishing mortality rate (F) which is common to all stocks and a target biomass which is a set fraction of a stock's virgin biomass. Using a multispecies management strategy evaluation, I compare expected outcomes for a set of these harvest control rules with alternative scenarios, in which each stock has its own F based on the assessment process. I find that the simple framework can produce outcomes that are similar to those from the more sophisticated estimates of F. I therefore conclude that achieving multispecies MSY may depend more upon setting reasonable biomass targets and faithfully applying a harvest control rule approach rather than determining the best possible Fs for each stock.},

abstract = {The traditional 'fishing effort' approach to fisheries economics implies the existence of a production function with fishing effort and fish abundance as independent variables. The existence of bionomic equilibrium depends on the shape of this production function, as well as the demand and effort cost functions. The analysis is related to the recent discussion of collapses in fisheries occurring as a result of fish availability being inversely related to fish abundance. Fishing effort is regarded as being produced by labor and capital, and an effort frontier production function is estimated for selected Norwegian fisheries. This makes it possible to estimate optimal vessel size and capital intensity. Fishing vessels appear to be undersized but not too capital intensive.-from Author},

Targeted food and beverage taxes and subsidies are prominent examples of such potential intervention strategies. This paper examines the differential effects of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages by calories and by ounces on beverage demand. To properly measure the extent of substitution and complementarity between beverage products, we developed a fully modified distance metric model of differentiated product demand that endogenizes the cross-price effects. We illustrated the proposed methodology in a linear approximate almost ideal demand system, although other flexible demand systems can also be used. In the empirical application using supermarket scanner data, the product-level demand model consists of 178 beverage products with combined market share of over 90{\%}. The novel demand model outperformed the conventional distance metric model in non-nested model comparison tests and in terms of the economic significance of model predictions. In the fully modified model, a calorie-based beverage tax was estimated to cost {\$}1.40 less in compensating variation than an ounce-based tax per 3,500 beverage calories reduced. This difference in welfare cost estimates between two tax strategies is more than three times as much as the difference estimated by the conventional distance metric model. If applied to products purchased from all sources, a 0.04-cent per kcal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is predicted to reduce annual per capita beverage intake by 5,800 kcal.},

Here, the assumption that an ITQ-regime will lead to an immediate reduction of catch capacity and discourage investment in the fisheries seems questionable, as the ITQ-regime seems to represent an input of "new" capital into the fisheries. As a result of quota leasing arrangements, tenancy relations have developed between parts of the coastal fleet and companies with large quota holdings. Crew wages have in these cases dropped, a situation that has provoked two strikes among fishermen. The demand for quotas is influenced by unemployment and lack of alternative sources of income for fishermen. Municipalities are in a number of cases significant participants in the quota market, as there are strong ties between companies and municipalities. A redistribution of wealth and income is taking place as a result of the system. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

ABSTRACT Spatial and temporal variations in the meat weight of sea scallops were examined in the Georges Bank fishery. From 1998–2007, 31 commercial scallop vessels supplied 145 dissections from the last tow of their fishing trip. During the dissection process we recorded the shell height, meat weight, sex, gonad weight, and visceral tissue weight. Meat weight was regressed against shell height (LnðMWÞ ¼ a + b ln SH). Predicted meat weight varied by up to 29{\%} for a 120 mm shell height scallop among months. Scallop meat weight varied by 31{\%} for a 120 mm shell height scallop between areas in the same month. The Southern Flank of Georges Bank had a different pattern of monthly variation in meat weight, possibly because of a spring spawning event observed in the gonadal indices. These spatial and temporal differences in meat weight could affect harvest, and harvest rate, with a 22{\%} difference in scallops harvested between June and October calculated from a hypothetical fishery. Understanding these spatial and temporal variations in the shell height/meat weight relationship is important for optimal harvest, especially if a fully rotational area management strategy is implemented.},

Research regarding consumer purchasing behavior has traditionally looked at store choice as a nested discrete choice decision; however, we propose an alternative approach that models consumer store choice preferences for store attribute bundles, including product assortment, store services, and price via the Distance Metric (DM) method of Pinkse, Slade, and Brett (2002). Methodologically, the use of the DM method offers a straightforward way to measure substitution patterns between stores with similar attributes.

abstract = {If farmers are risk averse, greater farm income variability should increase off-farm labor supply. This effect is confirmed for a sample of Kansas farmers. Off-farm employment of farmers and their spouses is also found to be significantly influenced by farm experience, off-farm work experience, farm size, leverage, efficiency, and farm-specific education. In addition, farm operators and spouses who receive significant income support through government farm programs are less likely to work off the farm. This may suggest that policy changes reducing farm income support payments may increase off-farm employment of farmers and their spouses.},

abstract = {A temporally and spatially variable Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) was established as a marine protected area along the US west coast in 2002 to protect stocks of rockfishes Sebastes spp. Since the RCA falls within the region sampled annually by the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, we utilized data collected from 2003 to 2011 to evaluate whether establishment of the RCA influenced catch per unit effort (CPUE), species richness, and size distribution of demersal fishes. We compared CPUE and species richness among 3 management areas (continuously closed, periodically closed, and open to commercial bottom trawling) using analysis of covariance models that account for variability due to area, year, and depth. The most appropriate models for CPUE (35 species treated individually and aggregated into 6 subgroups) and species richness were selected using Akaike's information criterion. All of the best-fit models were highly significant (p {\textless}0.0001), explaining 3 to 76{\%} of the variation in catch. For 27 species and 5 subgroups, mean CPUE was significantly greater within the area continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling relative to areas periodically closed or open. The most appropriate model for richness included area and year, and mean richness was greatest in the area continuously closed to trawling. Species-specific length composition distributions were calculated from subsampled individual lengths for 31 species. Significant differences in length frequency distributions were observed, with a higher proportion (∼65{\%}) of larger fish most often present in areas continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling (20 of 31 species) relative to other areas. Our data suggest that the RCA is an effective management tool for conserving not only rockfishes, but also other demersal fish species. {\textcopyright}Inter-Research 2014.},

Sectors are self-organized, self-managed groups of fishermen that receive an-nual catch entitlements. We hypothesize that the success and longevity of these sectors is likely to depend, in part, on the relationships amongst the members including their degree of trust and ability to collaborate. The value of these relationships and the ability to cooperate is commonly referred to as social capital. Prior to the implemen-tation of the new sector system, we conducted a survey to derive baseline measures of social capital for individual groundfish permit holders and sectors. We construct indi-ces of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust. We explore correlations between these social capital indices, characteristic of the vessels in the sectors, and various measures of economic performance of sectors.},

The results are then discussed in the context of other commodity markets, specifically live cattle, which is a substitute. We show that the seasonally adjusted model proposed in this article describes the behavior of salmon price very well. More importantly we show that seasonality exists in the salmon futures market.

The eco-label has been recognized as a means of promoting products with lower environmental impact. A considerable body of literature has focused on consumer demand for eco-label use: however, little attention has been paid to producers. Because the adoption decision is voluntary, a better understanding of producers' adoption behaviors towards eco-labels could significantly determine the effectiveness of the program. This paper contributes to this policy issue by assessing the impacts of the Taiwan Good Agricultural Products program, a combined eco-label and food traceability system, on the distribution of aquaculture producers' income in Taiwan. Using a unique aquaculture producer survey in Taiwan, we examine the extent to which label use may affect the level of income, income variability and income inequality of the producers. Our findings suggest that eco-label use increases income and that the effect is more pronounced for producers at the higher percentile range of income distribution. Label use also increases income variability, but no significant effect on income inequality is evident. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Birkenbach2020,
abstract = {Fishers face multidimensional decisions: when to fish, what species to target, and how much gear to deploy. Most bioeconomic models assume single-species fisheries with perfectly elastic demand and focus on inter-seasonal dynamics. In real-world fisheries, vessels hold quotas for multiple species with heterogeneous biological and/or market conditions that vary intra-seasonally. We analyze within-season behavior in multispecies fisheries with individual fishing quotas, accounting for stock aggregations, capacity constraints, and downward-sloping demand. Numerical results demonstrate variation in harvest patterns. We specifically find: (1) harvests for species with downward-sloping demand tend to spread out; (2) spreading harvest of a high-value species can cause lower-value species to be harvested earlier in the season; and (3) harvest can be unresponsive or even respond negatively to biological aggregation when fishers balance incentives in multispecies settings. We test these using panel data from the Norwegian multispecies groundfish fishery and find evidence for all three. We extend the numerical model to account for transitions to management with individual fishing quotas in multispecies fisheries. We show that, under some circumstances, fishing seasons could contract or spread out.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the US Atlantic sea scallop fishery regulations has resulted in recovery from a biological standpoint. However, due to excessive harvest capability and regulatory inefficiencies, the industry is facing substantial harvesting costs and, hence, economic inefficiency. The main reason is that most regulations or restrictions do not take into account the fundamental importance of the property rights for inducing behavior more consonant with aggregate as well as individual rationality. This article conceptualizes the role and importance of property rights structures in their application to Atlantic sea scallop fishery management. Additionally, embryonic industry efforts in developing an enhancement program for this fishery may point to the need for more cooperative, area-based management strategies. By doing so, two important elements for achieving greater production and value from the scallop fishery are identified. First, establishing an ownership structure of private property rights in the form of Territorial User Rights in Fishing (TURFs) and second, having fishermen cooperate under an organizational structure, such as a harvesters' cooperative. These elements imply that an alternative, rights-based cooperative approach may become a compatible governance arrangement and provide an incentive for the rational management of the scallop fishery. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is difficult to predict how these regulations will influence angler participation and recreational fishing mortality. This research integrates a utility-theory con-sistent model of demand for recreational fishing trips with an age-structured stock dynamics model to provide policy relevant advice to managers of the groundfish fishery in the Northeast United States. The recreational cod and haddock regulations implemented in 2014 have high costs in terms of foregone angler welfare and minimal positive impacts on stock conditions after three years. The ability of policies that generate large amounts of dis-carding, like high minimum size limits, to meet conservation objectives are also found to be quite sensitive to assumptions about the recreational discard mortality rate.},

To examine the above question, this paper uses the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index and its five sub-indices, namely government size, property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade, and setting proper regulations. Using data from 99 sample countries over the period 1970-2010, the system GMM estimates suggest that the negative growth effects of resource rents may turn positive in countries with greater economic freedom.},

The adaptive management approaches typically used for this require the development of new policy instruments and measures when needed, but also evaluations of instruments and measures already in use or under way. This paper reports on a study of the Swedish individual transferable quota system introduced in 2009 for the pelagic fishery. The new system was motivated mainly by economic arguments and, thus, the need to get incentives right. Despite this, the design of the Swedish system weakened the intended incentive effects in several ways, compared with the foreign systems that served as models. Moreover, the information needed for future evaluations was not collected, even though the need for future evaluations had been expressed explicitly and the data needs for this could be identified at the time that the system was introduced.},

abstract = {Seafood distribution systems are often viewed as exogenous from fisheries and marine resource management. However, these systems are closely coupled. The transportation and transformation of fish out of water (i.e., distribution and processing) is affected by and affects the resource and those that exploit and manage it. Despite this linkage, the feedback between harvesting and post-harvesting activities has been largely unstudied, reinforcing an artificial disconnect. This paper brings focus to this gap by examining the interplay between seafood distribution and social-ecological resilience - arguably an important objective of fisheries management. Drawing on the notion of "portfolio" fishing, this paper seeks to extend the concept beyond the material boundaries of the resource itself and the individual strategies of those who harvest marine resources, using the Atlantic herring and Spiny dogfish in New England as case studies. The broader interpretation of portfolio fishing allows us to understand seafood distribution as a new axis of diversification that has direct implications for the social-ecological resilience of fisheries. Expanding the geography of resilience in fisheries inland, beyond the existing regulatory 'wrack line,' brings to focus the interrelatedness of fisheries and distribution, and raises challenging questions about how to deal with social-ecological systems that extend beyond the borders of regulatory control.},

abstract = {Productivity change after transition to an individual transferable quota (ITQ) management system is driven by exit of some vessels, entry of other vessels, and changes in productivity of existing vessels. Generally, it is thought that an ITQ system boosts productivity due to the exit of less productive vessels. However, ITQ management systems also create an additional barrier to entry, and more productive vessels may not be able to enter the fishery. This study constructs the F{\"{a}}re-Primont index to measure productivity change for the Mid-Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery over a 32 year time period, which includes both pre and post-ITQ time periods. The index is then combined with a biomass change index to arrive at a measure of biomass adjusted productivity change. Results show that when biomass changes are considered, positive productivity gains occurred throughout the time period. Further examination of contributions from entering and survivor vessels show that entering vessels had little impact on aggregate productivity, but on an individual basis, they eventually were equal in productivity to survivor vessels.},

Twenty years after the expansion of exclusive economic zones over most of the continental shelves, fisheries worldwide face problems of stock depletion, declining yields and increasing conflict. Other human activities in the ocean compound the effect. What is wrong? This paper is about the internal workings of fishery governance and their links to fishery outcomes. The theme of this paper is that there are fundamental weaknesses in the way fishery governance works that contribute to sustainability problems. Basic requirements for healthy ocean fishery governance are not being met because the scope and structure of governance are weak. Although the particular forms of weakness vary with fisheries and with geopolitical regions, the substance of the weakness is common across all regions. What we ask of fishery governance is that it coordinate institutional rules and individual actions by performing certain functions: incorporate multiple objectives representing different types of conservation and use; bring the time horizons of private individuals into line with those of the public; send signals of resource scarcity and enable effective adaptive responses; promote legitimacy by reflecting accepted norms of equity and by controlling harmful opportunism; contain both the level and distribution of transactions costs. Fishery governance is failing to adequately perform these functions as a result of the attributes of management scope and management structure. At both national and international levels, improvement of governance will rest on the adoption of a stable long-term management scope and the construction of flexible management structures.},

abstract = {As more no-take marine reserves are established, the importance of evaluating effectiveness retrospectively is growing. This paper adapts methods from program evaluation to quantify the effects of establishing a marine reserve on fisheries using fishery-dependent data. The approach analyzes the effects of a policy at the individual vessel level and accommodates the coarse spatial resolution of fishing logbooks. It illuminates implicit assumptions in previous ret-rospective analyses of marine reserves that are unlikely to hold for large-scale fisheries. We illustrate the empirical model with an application to the Gulf of Mexico reef-fish fishery. Isolating the effects of reserves requires a full ac-counting of multiple gear production technologies, heterogeneity in vessel captain skill, spatial heterogeneity of fish stocks, seasonal patterns in abundance, the effects of coexisting management policies, and the possibility that the har-vest sector anticipates reserve establishment.

We also find that the optimal harvest rule may include closure of some areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent basis (biological reserves).

abstract = {A spatially-structured simulation model of the metapopulation dynamics of common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and their harvest by line fishing was developed to evaluate potential management options on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), including closing areas to fishing. The effects of line fishing simulator (ELFSim) incorporates a spatially-structured model of the life-history of common coral trout, including larval dispersal, harvest by multiple fishing sectors (commercial, charter and recreational), and a range of mechanisms for regulating harvest. The model is designed to allow considerable flexibility in biological and fishery dynamics, to be portable to contexts other than the GBR, and to be modular to allow comparison of different implementations of biological and harvest model components. In this paper, we describe the details of the model and discuss its utility as a tool for evaluating fishery management strategies in the context of diverse stakeholder expectations. We illustrate a simple application by changing the rate at which larvae settle on the reef from which they were spawned, under a range of spatial closures and a scenario of steadily increasing fishing effort. The results identify the conditions under which a "larval subsidy effect" may be important to the performance of fishery management strategies. This effect was manifest as increased catches outside of areas closed to fishing when larvae were freely exchanged among reefs compared to when larval exchange was diminished or absent. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2).

Using housing transactions data from California's Bay Area between 1990 and 2006, we apply our estimator to recover marginal willingness to pay for reductions in three of the EPA's “criteria” air pollutants.

abstract = {Population structure and vital rates of Gulf of Maine (GOM) humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, were studied by a combination of longitudinal data, region-wide surveys and modern mark-recapture statistical methods. Demography and rates of exchange were examined among six GOM areas. Juveniles and females were preferentially encountered in southern GOM habitats, including at the Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS). Multi-state modelling also revealed unequal probabilities of movement between areas that was not explained by inter-area distance, adjacency, whale density or dominant prey type. Aerial surveys and photo-identification data indicated that the population was likely closed to migration between June and September. Otherwise, seasonal trends in population composition were consistent the demographically staggered migration reported in other oceans. Over-wintering occurred, but there was little evidence that a significant number of humpback whales failed to undertake or complete migration each year.Vital rates varied with sex, age and time. Juveniles exhibited lower and more variable survival than adults and so were a potential source of downward bias in ``non-calf'' survival estimates. Males exhibited higher survival than females and achieved maximal survival at age five, the estimated age at male puberty. By contrast, females did not reach peak survival until the current average age at first birth (8.78 years, s = 2.33). The latter was significantly higher than previous estimates and females that recruited by age seven had a lower likelihood of subsequent survival than those that recruited late. Costs of reproduction persisted into adulthood, with breeders exhibiting lower survival than nonbreeders. Calves born during years of low fecundity exhibited lower survival than those born when fecundity was high, possibly due to lower maternal investment. Costs of reproduction have not previously been described in cetaceans, but are consistent with the risks potentially associated with capital breeding.},

abstract = {Fish populations have the potential to contribute to the long-term economic and social benefit of humans, but to do so they must be managed in ways which maintain ecological health. There are many ways that management performance can be assessed, but four measures are particularly pertinent to sustainability: equity, stewardship, regulatory resilience, and efficiency. A key factor in management performance is the process by which management tools are developed and implemented. One approach that has been recommended to improve performance is to structure the management process around user participation. The paper analyzes three case studies of user participation in ad hoc processes of Pacific groundfish management: the development of a license limitation program; an inter-gear sablefish allocation; and the development of a sablefish individual quota (IQ) program. The case studies illustrate the role played by participation in contributing to the equity, stewardship, resilience, and efficiency of the management process. The effect of user participation was mixed in the three cases, depending on the history of participation, the structure and process of participation, on resource conditions and on the characteristics of the program under consideration. Participation can contribute positively to fishery management performance when there is a history of collective decision-making, the time line is slow enough to allow a full consideration of the issues, educational possibilities are pursued and the condition of the resource allows equitable compromises. {\textcopyright} 1996.},

abstract = {A method using Monte Carlo simulations for estimating fishery reference points that accounts for parameter uncertainty is presented. Uncertainties in the input parameters of yield-per-recruit and stock-recruit analyses are propagated to estimate uncertainty in reference points such as FMSY. These uncertainties are used to evaluate the tradeoffs between the risks of overfishing and stock collapse, and the cost of reduced expected yield due to setting fishing mortality below FMSY. At fishing mortalities near FMSY, reduction in fishing mortality substantially decreases the probability of overfishing and stock collapse in exchange for slightly reduced expected yield. At lower fishing mortality rates, the marginal benefit (in terms of lessened risk of overfishing and stock collapse) from further reductions in fishing mortality is less, and the cost in forgone yield is greater. Less resilient “low steepness” stocks require additional precaution due to the risk of complete population collapse. Marine protected areas can also reduce risks of collapse, but at a higher cost in terms of expected yield than effort reduction. Implementation uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty in achieving a fishing mortality target) increases the risk of overfishing as well the loss of yield due to precaution, except at fishing mortalities near or above FMSY.},

abstract = {The present study presents new evidence regarding the factors that influence the exit decisions of vessels from fisheries, especially the effects of fishery subsidies. To estimate and better understand the impact of a set of variables on the exit rate of the Spanish purse seine fleet, we use parametric analysis of duration models. The Gamma accelerated failure-time (AFT) model with inverse Gaussian heterogeneity was found to be the best-fitting model.This paper finds that assistance for the scrapping of vessels, the establishment of joint ventures, and vessel export have positive effects on the probability of a vessel's exit from the Spanish purse seine fishery fleet. The results also show that fishing vessels operating with only one type of main fishing gear are more likely to leave the fishery than those that operate using different main fishing gear to improve the profitability of their fishing activities. Furthermore, we observe that vessels that operate in EU waters are less likely to leave the fisheries. In addition, the engine power and tonnage were variables that did not contribute significantly to the model, indicating that they are not crucial factors for the survival of purse seine vessels. Finally, as anticipated, the analysis of revenues allows us to conclude that vessels with low incomes are more likely to leave the fishery.},

@article{Smith2004,
abstract = {Given a paucity of empirical data, policy-makers are forced to rely on modeling to assess potential im-pacts of creating marine reserves to manage fisheries. Many modeling studies of reserves conclude that fishing yield will increase (or decrease only modestly) after creating a reserve in a heavily exploited fishery. However, much of the ma-rine reserves modeling ignores the spatial heterogeneity of fishing behavior. Contrary to empirical findings in fisheries science and economics, most models assume explicitly or implicitly that fishing effort is distributed uniformly over space. This paper demonstrates that by ignoring this hetero-geneity, yield-per-recruit models systematically overstate the yield gains (or understate the losses) from creating a reserve in a heavily exploited fishery. Conversely, at very low levels of exploitation, models that ignore heterogeneous fishing ef-fort overstate the fishing yield losses from creating a reserve. Starting with a standard yield-per-recruit model, the paper derives a yield surface that maps spatially differentiated fish-ing effort into total long-run fishing yield. It is the curvature of this surface that accounts for why the spatial distribution of fishing effort so greatly affects predicted changes from forming a reserve. The results apply generally to any model in which the long-run fishing yield has similar curvature to a two-patch Beverton-Holt model. A simulation of marine reserve forma-tion in the California red sea urchin fishery with Beverton-Holt recruitment, eleven patches, and common larval pool dispersal dynamics reinforces these results.},

abstract = {A discrete choice model is applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the English and Welsh North Sea beam trawl fleet. Individual vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice, and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort, past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience) and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod 2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort, and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10{\%} misallocation of predicted effort for that year. ?? 2012.},

It included a new program intended to allow for “flexibility” through inter-sectoral trading, permitting charter operators to lease commercial halibut pounds to relax client harvest restrictions. Here we evaluate the first two years of lease market activity and participation. Participation from some commercial quota holders in the lease market suggests that the program provided beneficial flexibility; in fact, the number of transfers to the charter sector was greater than transfers within the commercial sector for some quota types. We also identified a high proportion of self-leasers. However, transfers to the charter sector were on average smaller than within-sector commercial transfers, and total poundage leased by the charter sector was low compared with commercial transfers. Usage of leased quota by the recreational charter sector enables the harvest of larger fish or additional fish, and provides flexibility in catch composition on halibut closure days. Finally, the value-per-pound may be higher in the charter sector, as commercial-to-charter transfer prices approached the commercial ex-vessel price.},

abstract = {Fish stocks, as common pool resources, are more and more managed by giving fishermen exclusive access rights as Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ). They have been widely discussed with focus on social, economic and ecological issues. While equity aspects have been of great concern, there is a very limited analysis about how to assess issues of equity and fair distribution when introducing ITQs. This paper applies an existing framework for assessing equity in resource use systems to tradable quota systems in fisheries. The framework defines the perspectives of distributive fairness, the stakeholders who are bound by fair practice rules, and instruments of fairness, and identifies metrics to assess equity in practice. We assess if the framework provides practical guidance for evaluating whether a given ITQ system operates under an equitable framework programme.},

This study introduces a two-stage approach by applying the double hurdle model to analyse probability of loan default and the magnitude of the default as a way of relaxing this restrictive assumption. Using the model, this study is able to isolate the determinants of default rate from the determinants of the probability of default. The control function approach is used to test and control for potential endogeneity of loan amount and profit in the probability of default equation. The model is applied to primary data from a survey of 200 small scale entrepreneurs in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Results show that enterprise size, interest rate, loan duration, level of profit and loan amount are the simultaneous determinants of probability and rate of default. The study recommends that the National Board for Small Scale Industries should intensify training programmes aimed at enhancing the managerial and technical capabilities of entrepreneurs to ensure healthy and productive management to promote enterprise growth and increase profit margins and hence reduce defaults.},

Results find that clam fishermen search new sites when the catch at familiar sites declines, i.e., when the opportunity cost of gathering information is low, and also when catch at familiar sites is on the rise. Search following a catch decline occurs at spatially distant sites whereas search following a catch increase occurs at nearby sites. Correlated learning is crucial for explaining the site choice patterns in our data. These results provide new insights that may extend to a variety of economic search problems where correlated learning is important.},

abstract = {Recent economic literature on pro-poor growth measurement is drawn together, using a common analytical framework which lends itself to some significant extensions. First, a new class of pro-poorness measures is defined, to complement existing classes, with similarities and differences which are fully discussed. Second, all of these measures of pro-poorness can be decomposed across income sources or components of consumption expenditure (depending on the application). This permits the analyst to “unbundle” a pattern of growth, revealing the contributions to overall pro-poorness of constituent parts. Third, all of these pro-poorness measures can be modified to measure pro-poorness at percentiles. An application to consumption expenditures in Indonesia in the 1990s reveals that the poverty reduction achieved remains far below what would have been achieved under distributional neutrality. This can be tracked back to changes in expenditure components.  },

abstract = {This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary.

The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected.},

abstract = {In 2011 the National Marine Fisheries Service began a systematic collection of performance indicators for U.S. fisheries managed under catch shares. Catch shares are a fishery management tool that dedicate a secure share of quota allowing individual fishermen, fishing cooperatives, fishing communities, or other entities to harvest a fixed amount of fish. Catch share design varies widely across different programs and regions. Many programs share similar biological, social, and economic management objectives even though these design features are tailored to accommodate particular fishery characteristics. This paper evaluates fisheries using standardized indicators to measure the basic economic performance, regardless of catch share program design. Data collected were used to evaluate the economic and distribution effects of U.S. catch share programs. Catch share fishery performance is compared to a baseline period prior to implementation of the catch share program. Overall, the majority of objectives to improve the economic performance of catch share fisheries were achieved. Catch share programs have been effective in reducing fishing capacity. However, catch share programs have had distributional consequences as there are indications that consolidation is occurring in a number of programs. For example, there have been considerable reductions in the number of active vessels and entities holding quota share in the Alaska Halibut and Sablefish and the Mid-Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog catch share programs. However, it is important to note that the accumulation of ownership share may be less of a concern than consolidation in the use of quota. Thus, to the extent that consolidation is considered a management problem, it may be more effective to consider caps on the use of quota than by imposing more restrictive ownership caps.},

abstract = {In 1976, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCA), later renamed the Magnuson-Stevens Act, was signed into law to implement the management of living marine resources (Public Law 109-479). The Act has since been renamed and amended several times (National Research Council 1994, Darcy and Matlock 1999), most recently through the 2006 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSRA). The MSRA added, among other things, new requirements for fishery management councils to set annual catch limits (ACLs) and establish accountability measures (AMs) for each of its managed fisheries to ensure that overfishing (i.e., F {\textgreater} FMSY) does not occur (Public Law 94-265). To assist the eight regional fishery management councils in implementing the new ACL and AM requirements, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) revised its National Standard 1 (NS1) guidelines, which provides guidance on how conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery (see 74 FR 3178, January 16, 2009). Because the guidelines are written for a general audience, greater technical detail has often been needed to further explain how certain aspects of the MSA should be implemented (Restrepo and Powers 1999). For example, in the NS1 guidelines, the “vulnerability” of fish stocks is referenced as one of the bases for: 1) differentiating between stocks that are “in the fishery” versus those that are “ecosystem components,” 2) defining stock complexes, and 3) creating a buffer between target and limit fishing mortality reference points. While the NS1 guidelines define the term “vulnerability,” during the scoping period NMFS received several public comments requesting that they further describe how the vulnerability of a stock should be evaluated, especially for stocks for which biological or fishery data are limited (termed “data-poor” stocks). In response, a Vulnerability Evaluation Work Group (VEWG) was established to develop a methodology for determining the vulnerability of data-poor stocks managed under a fishery management plan (FMP). The objective of this report is to explain the methodology developed for determining vulnerability and present six example applications to U.S. fisheries. We begin by reviewing the need for assessing vulnerability for the three tasks identified above.},

In particular, this applies to the so‐called  matrix, which is integral to the structure of endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost the sine qua non of spatial econometrics. Moreover, it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving  may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the effects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.},

abstract = {Many fisheries around the world are plagued with the problem of bycatch-the inadvertent harvesting and discard of non-targeted species. Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Analysis of management actions affecting crew wages and well-being is often limited due to a dearth of available data. We examine crew-related outcomes during the first six years of the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program using two unique datasets–a mandatory economic survey and a voluntary social science study. We find that impacts on crew compensation differ from other catch share programs due to prior conditions of the fishery and also vary by the target species within the program. The median number of crew positions per vessel increased slightly, annual crew days decreased, and crew wage as a percentage of revenue was nearly unchanged, even with the introduction of new costs. Median daily crew compensation increased from {\$}514 per day to {\$}776 after implementation of catch shares and annual compensation increased from {\$}33 thousand to {\$}39 thousand. Many crew members expressed a lack of support for the program and job satisfaction did not rise with increased wages and fewer days at sea, indicating that job satisfaction is likely influenced by more than compensation and effort.},

Because RBM on catch or effort necessarily requires a total allowable catch (TAC) or total allowable effort (TAE), RBM is discussed in conjunction with issues in assessing fish populations and providing TACs or TAEs. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and there are trade-offs between the two approaches. In a narrow economic sense, catch rights are superior because of the type of incentives created, but once the costs of research to improve stock assessments and the associated risks of determining the TAC and costs of monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement are taken into consideration, the choice between catch or effort RBM becomes more complex and less clear. The results will be case specific. Hybrid systems based on both catch and effort are increasingly employed to manage marine fisheries to capture the advantages of both approaches. In hybrid systems, catch or effort RBM dominates and controls on the other supplements. RBM using either catch or effort by itself addresses only the target species stock externality and not the remaining externalities associated with by-catch and the ecosystem.},

abstract = {There are significant challenges in studying economic effects of crab rationalization on Kodiak. There are important differences between crab fisheries, and within each fishery there are differences in boat sizes, vessel ownership, quota allocation, and many other factors which affect how quota is fished. Many factors besides rationalization affect crab fisheries, and many factors besides crab fisheries affect Kodiak's economy—making it difficult to identify the specific effects of crab rationalization on Kodiak General Economic Effects of Crab Rationalization Rationalization began very recently. It is far too early to know what the long-term effects of crab rationalization will be on how many boats fish, on crab fishing jobs and earnings, on quota lease rates, on crab markets and prices, and on communities. Since rationalization began in the 2005/06 season, there have been very rapid and dramatic changes in the crab fisheries. Between the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons, vessel registration declined by about two-thirds for the Bristol Bay Red King Crab (BBR) fishery and by about one-half for the Bering Sea Snow Crab (BSS) fishery.},

New findings run the gamut from slow processes operating over large spatial scales to episodic events operating locally over small scales. The implications of this new understanding are explored, focusing particularly on new theories of the role that oceanographic processes play in distributing larvae, juveniles, and adults into the coastal environment. A new spatial management paradigm is en-visioned whereby electronic vessel and gear monitoring allows management of effort at fine temporal and spatial scales. The research challenges of this new vision of future management are then discussed, focusing on understanding spa-tial behavior of fishermen, developing integrated spatial bioeconomic management models, and exploring alternative management instruments for regulating the spatial distribution of harvesting.},

We analyze many sorts of inequality (in earnings, disposable income, consumption expenditures and wealth) for different sections of the economic distribution. Here we highlight three central findings. • In 2010, the bottom 20 percent of the U.S. earnings distribution was doing much worse, relative to the median, than in the entire postwar period. This is because their earnings (including wages, salaries, and business and farm income) fell by about 30 percent relative to the median over the course of the recession. This lowest quintile also did poorly in terms of wealth, which declined about 40 percent. • Redistribution through taxes and transfer programs reached historically high levels in 2010. As a result, spending power, captured by disposable income and consumption expenditures on nondurables, of this same lowest 20 percent did not significantly change relative to other economic groups during the recession. • Although government redistribution protected households from fully bearing the impact of an earnings decline, households that experienced such a decrease nonetheless endured sizable drops in disposable income and drops in consumption expenditures.},

The analysis is conducted separately at the zipcode, county, and state levels. Results indicate that proxies for labor market pooling have the most robust effect, positively influencing agglomeration at all levels of geography. Proxies for knowledge spillovers, in contrast, positively affect agglomeration only at the zipcode level. Reliance on manufactured inputs or natural resources positively affects agglomeration at the state level but has little effect on agglomeration at lower levels of geography. The same is true for the perishability of output, a proxy for product shipping costs.},

Sector members were surveyed prior to the implementation of the policy to develop baseline measures of social capital for each sector and again after the sectors had been operating for three years. We construct indices of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust and explore how these indicators of social capital have changed since the implementation of the sector program. We also evaluate the relationship between these social capital indicators and various measures of economic performance of sectors. The result suggests that the relationship between social capital and economic performance has strengthened over time. Profitability is associated with broader community and fishery-wide connections as well as bonding social capital within sectors.},

The procedure, which is based on the Shapley value in cooperative game theory, allows the deviation in regional poverty levels from the all-Russia average to be attributed to three proximate sources: per capita income, inequality, and local prices. Contrary to expectation, regional poverty variations turn out to be due more to differences in inequality across regions than to differences in real income per capita. However, when real income per capita is split into nominal income and price components, differences in nominal incomes emerge as more important than either inequality or price effects for the majority of regions. {\textcopyright} United Nations University 2005.},

On the negative side, one has to be very critical of using automatically the mean-variance criterion for choice among risky ventures. In fact, any variation of such a criterion, based on the mean and the variance alone, is generally invalid. The identification of riskiness with variance, or with any other single measure of dispersion, is clearly unsound. There are many obvious cases, where more dispersion is desirable, if it is accompanied by an upward shift in the location of the distribution, or by an increasing positive asymmetry. A more detailed analysis of the relation between skewness and risk is a desirable route to follow, if one is trying to restrict the information about distributions to a small number of parameters. The present analysis is carried out in terms of a single dimension, both for the utility functions and for the probability distributions.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed methodologies to model fisher behaviour with the aim of predicting the outcomes of decision-making on board a fishing vessel. Both short- and long-term processes (e.g. investment) impact fleet dynamics. The proposed structure of the models has tended to depend upon the nature of the fishery and the control variables (technical restrictions, quotas, effort control, and/or closed areas). For example, within the context of multi-stock, multi-fleet fisheries (mixed fisheries), a skipper will allocate effort (as input to the production process) to harvest a range of species. Spatial complexity is normally excluded in models of behaviour. In this paper, two spatial analyses are presented for modelling location choice: an analysis based on a random utility model (RUM), and a simplified simulation model of individual vessels that depends on the results of the RUM. These models are applied to the English beam-trawl fleet operating in the North Sea in 2000. The results from the RUM indicate that the number of trips, the average trip length, and the average effort in each ICES rectangle are significant variables affecting location choice, in addition to catch rate for the previous year (1999), weighted by value. The last result is used as an assumption in a simulation model of fishing effort, i.e. fishers make decisions on spatial location of operation on the basis of past catch rates. The simulation model is used to predict the distribution of the same fleet for one month during the temporary closure in the North Sea in 2001. The predicted values for effort relate well to the fishing patterns observed. Crown Copyright ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate. The methods proposed in this article produce informative inference regardless of the number of available comparison units, the number of available time periods, and whether the data are individual (micro) or aggregate (macro).

abstract = {Coastal areas of Cuba harbor rich biodiversity that provide a variety of important ecosystem services, including fisheries production. High-value invertebrate fisheries in Cuba are managed on the basis of scientific assessments, but comparable data and analyses are lacking for the much larger number of exploited finfish species. However, dramatic declines in finfish catch despite minimal management restrictions suggests resource depletion, and the need for scientific and management attention. To prioritize finfish for such attention, we conducted productivity-susceptibility analyses (PSA) for 34 species within each of Cuba's four fishery management zones. The resulting 136 estimates of vulnerability to overfishing revealed few differences in species-specific scores among zones, despite ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity along the Cuban coast. Vulnerability scores were generally low, although this relative metric does not necessarily mean that overfishing has not occurred. Spatial differences in catch composition relative to the vulnerability scores underscore potential differences in socioeconomic vulnerability of fishing communities based upon their reliance on different species. Therefore, our PSA results should be used to prioritize research, monitoring, and stock assessment efforts, as well as management actions, within each fishing zone to conserve locally important resources, recover those that are depleted, sustainably develop those that are underutilized, and promote ecological and socioeconomic stability across Cuba as it confronts the challenges of a changing world.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

Even though most celebrated clusters seem to be in high-cost areas, many econometric studies represent agglomeration externalities as increased primal productivity or reduced cost. While this certainly can be consistent with some observed agglomeration effects, it may be insufficient for the growth of a cluster. The key condition for this is that profitability is higher. The paper tests for agglomeration effects using a profit function approach. This may be particularly important for firms in high-cost clusters, where revenue effects can be as important as productivity and cost effects. The paper tests for both intra- and inter-industry agglomeration externalities using firm-level data. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Expectations about ecosystem based management (EBM) differ due to diverging perspectives about what EBM should be and how it should work. While EBM by its nature requires trade-offs to be made between ecological, economic and social sustainability criteria, the diversity of cross-sectoral perspectives, values, stakes, and the specificity of each individual situation determine the outcome of these trade-offs. The authors strive to raise awareness of the importance of interaction between three stakeholder groups (decision makers, scientists, and other actors) and argue that choosing appropriate degrees of interaction between them in a transparent way can make EBM more effective in terms of the three effectiveness criteria salience, legitimacy, and credibility. This article therefore presents an interaction triangle in which three crucial dimensions of stakeholder interactions are discussed: (A) between decision makers and scientists, who engage in framing to foster salience of scientific input to decision making, (B) between decision makers and other actors, to shape participation processes to foster legitimacy of EBM processes, and (C) between scientists and other actors, who collaborate to foster credibility of knowledge production. Due to the complexity of EBM, there is not one optimal interaction approach; rather, finding the optimal degrees of interaction for each dimension depends on the context in which EBM is implemented, i.e. the EBM objectives, the EBM initiator's willingness for transparency and interaction, and other context-specific factors, such as resources, trust, and state of knowledge.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the results of an investigation of management costs in the fisheries of Iceland. Newfoundland and Norway and discusses them in a more general framework. Management costs are defined as costs necessary to overcome the problems associated with common property. The question of whether management costs should be paid by industry is discussed, as is the likely effect of user pay on the efficiency with which management is provided. Since management has public goods characteristics, it is likely that there is an unavoidable role for government in providing these services. The question of who pays for it is separate, and recovering costs from industry has both efficiency and optimal taxation aspects. A greater involvement in management by industry further raises the question of compatibility between the industry's interests and the public interest. Measured as percent of gross value of fish landings the management costs are by far highest in Newfoundland (15-25{\%}), lowest in Iceland (about 3{\%}), with Norway in the middle (about 10{\%}). Management costs thus appear to be substantial and quite variable. This gives rise to three conclusions. First, when calculating optimal harvesting and investment paths one must take the management costs of implementing these paths explicitly into account. Second, what is the economic efficiency of management? Could the same level of benefits be produced at lower costs? Third, can fisheries management expenditures of the magnitude discussed be justified in the sense that the benefits exceed the costs? (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In all cases, own-price flexibility coefficient estimates satisfy the theoretical expectation of the general price-quantity relations and are less than one in absolute value, which indicates inflexibility of real wholesale prices to their corresponding quantities. It is also found that the majority of the quota species may be classified as nor-mal goods, as the price responses with respect to changes in income are positive for those species. The impact of structural change in the fishery, as a result of the introduction of the quota system, on the prices of quota species is also exam-ined, and it is observed that the quota management system has significantly affected the price of a few quota species.},

I demonstrate that combining diverse alternatives into a single outside option can result in distorted parameter estimates and misleading predictions. To evaluate the practical importance of how outside options are treated, I use data on the Florida spiny lobster and stone crab fisheries to compare a discrete choice model that explicitly accounts for individuals' ability to target both species with one that includes stone crab alternatives in the generic outside option. I find that parameter estimates and predictions for the lobster fishery depend heavily upon whether stone crab alternatives are explicitly accounted for. In addition, I conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments, which demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of differences in predictions between models are complex functions of the characteristics of the empirical environment. Together, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering the composition of outside options when estimating discrete choice models and making predictions based on the estimates.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are one of the property rights instruments that have been employed to improve economic efficiency in fisheries. ITQs are not high-quality property rights in the basic fundamental marine resources on which fisheries are based. As a result ITQs cannot be expected to generate full efficiency in the use of these resources. This article examines to what extent ITQs are capable of generating economic efficiency in fisheries. It is shown that ITQs can greatly improve efficiency in fishing. Moreover, by including recreational fishers in the system, ITQs can strike an efficient balance between commercial and recreational fishing. On the negative side, it is shown that on their own, ITQs are not capable of generating full efficiency in fisheries. In particular, ITQs are not sufficient for setting the socially optimal total allowable catch, ensuring the optimal use of the ecosystem, or harmonizing fishing with conflicting uses of marine resources such as marine tourism, mining, and conservation. Potentially counteracting these limitations, ITQ holders as a group have an incentive to manage overall ecosystem use for the long-term benefit of their fishery and negotiate the adjustment of their fishing activity toward the interests of conflicting uses of the marine resources.(JEL: Q2, Q22, Q26, Q3). {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = { This paper addresses the complex relationship between geography and macroeconomic growth. We investigate the ways in which geography may matter directly for growth, controlling for economic policies and institutions, as well as the effects of geography on policy choices and institutions. We find that location and climate have large effects on income levels and income growth, through their effects on transport costs, disease burdens, and agricultural productivity, among other channels. Furthermore, geography seems to be a factor in the choice of economic policy itself. When we identify geographical regions that are not conducive to modern economic growth, we find that many of these regions have high population density and rapid population increase. This is especially true of populations that are located far from the coast, and thus that face large transport costs for international trade, as well as populations in tropical regions of high disease burden.

@article{Singh2009,
abstract = {We consider the problem of multi-species fisheries management when targeting individual species is costly and at-sea discards of fish by fishermen are unobserved by the regulator. Stock conditions, ecosystem interaction, technological specification, and relative prices under which at-sea discards are acute are identified. A dynamic model is developed to balance ecological interdependencies among multiple fish species, and scope economies implicit in a costly targeting technology. Three regulatory regimes, species-specific harvest quotas, landing taxes, and revenue quotas, are contrasted against a hypothetical sole-owner problem. An optimal plan under all regimes precludes discarding. For both very low and very high levels of targeting costs, first best welfare is close to that achieved through any of the regulatory regimes. In general, however, landing taxes welfare dominate species-specific quota regulation; a revenue quota fares the worst. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Data from 4,713 fisheries worldwide, representing 78{\%} of global reported fish catch, are analyzed to estimate the status, trends, and benefits of alternative approaches to recovering depleted fisheries. For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32{\%} of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world's fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, {\$}53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

abstract = {The existing literature (i) examines bycatch and discard behavior in a static framework and (ii) treats bycatch as a deterministic process uniform across vessels. Using a dynamic representative agent model in a two-stock resource, this paper explores strategic interactions between a social planner and two groups of harvesters, one of which imposes a stochastic "technological externality" (bycatch) on the other. In addition to limitations on entry and the number of trips taken in each industry, three bycatch control instruments are compared to the unconstrained case: taxes, trip limits, and value-based quotas. Implementation and enforcement costs aside, taxes dominate both types of quota, and value limits outperform trip limits by eliminating one type of discarding. In simulations, relative performance depends upon variance in the bycatch process, differences in the ex vessel prices of stocks, relative efficiency of the harvester types, and fixed costs on the trip and industry margins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Trawl survey data with high spatial and seasonal coverage were analysed using a variant of the Log Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) statistical model to estimate unbiased relative fish densities. The model estimates correlations between observations according to time, space, and fish size and includes zero observations and over-dispersion. The model utilises the fact the correlation between numbers of fish caught increases when the distance in space and time between the fish decreases, and the correlation between size groups in a haul increases when the difference in size decreases. Here the model is extended in two ways. Instead of assuming a natural scale size correlation, the model is further developed to allow for a transformed length scale. Furthermore, in the present application, the spatial- and size-dependent correlation between species was included. For cod (Gadus morhua) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), a common structured size correlation was fitted, and a separable structure between the time and space-size correlation was found for each species, whereas more complex structures were required to describe the correlation between species (and space-size). The within-species time correlation is strong, whereas the correlations between the species are weaker over time but strong within the year.},

@article{Abbott2022,
abstract = {Fisheries managers have increasingly adopted rights-based management (i.e., “catch shares” or “individual transferable quotas” [ITQs]) to address economic and biological management challenges under prior governance regimes. Despite their ability to resolve some of the symptoms of the tragedy of the commons and improve economic efficiency, catch shares remain controversial for their potentially disruptive social effects. One criticism is that the benefits of rights-based reforms are unequally distributed across vessels and between fishery participants (e.g., crew and hired captains) and that stakeholders that do not receive an allocation of harvest rights may see their remuneration decrease. Yet, empirically assessing these claims is difficult in almost all ITQs due to poor availability of longitudinal cost, earnings, and employment data. This paper evaluates these claims using vessel-level data to characterize impacts of a long-established ITQ program for Alaskan crab fisheries on the level and distribution of payments to claimant groups. We find that the share of vessel proceeds accruing to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined under the catch-share regime to make room for new payments to quota owners. Average daily payments to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined, albeit slightly, yet retained their pre-ITQ premia relative to compensation in other sectors. However, inequality in payments to workers and vessel owners declined after ITQs, as did the interseasonal volatility in compensation to workers, a measure of financial risk. Finally, we find that consolidation-induced increases in leasing costs have had little effect on workers' remuneration, but have reduced returns to vessel ownership.},

We derive and estimate both a structural dynamic model using Bellman's equation, and a reduced-form static model with trip probability expressions mimicking those of the dynamic model. We illustrate an inherent identification problem in the reduced-form model that creates biased welfare estimates, and we discuss the general implications of this for the interpretation of preference parameters in static models. We then use both models to simulate trip taking behavior and show that although their in-sample trip forecasts are similar, their welfare estimates and out-of-sample forecasts are quite different. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Two methods of estimation are used: (1) increase in book value of fishing rights, and (2) annual amortization of quotas multiplied by their time of validity. It is found that the price of quotas, in most cases, exceeds the profit rate in the fishery and is often higher than the contribution margin. Hence quota prices in most cases exceed the resource rent and are more consistent with a willingness to pay for additional quotas bought to improve the utilization of existing equipment, in which case fixed costs are irrelevant. The puzzle of quota prices in many cases exceeding the contribution margin can be resolved by assuming that boat owners expect to keep a substantial portion of their purchased quotas through redistribution and use a low discount rate when evaluating quotas.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods.},

abstract = {Manufacturing employment in the United States has tended to fall since 1979. Geographically, the Northeast and Mideast regions have incurred the brunt of this decline and, except in the Southwest region, urban countries have tended to fare worse than rural countries. Meanwhile, foreign-owned manufacturing has been playing a larger role in the U.S. economy, especially in the Great Lakes and Southeast regions. The current research explains the pattern-among regions as well as between rural and urban countries-of new foreign plant location. Proxies measuring economic size, labor force quality, agglomeration and urbanization economies, and transportation infrastructure are found to affect the location of new foreign-owned plants positively, while proxies for unit labor costs and taxes are found to deter the location of new plants. The key advantages of the Great Lakes region stem from relatively low unit labor costs and high manufacturing density, while high manufacturing density and low taxes are the key advantages of the Southeast region. Comparing urban with rural countries, nearly all the explanatory variables possess average values for urban countries that are more favorable to foreign direct investment. For example, the labor force is relatively more productive and skilled in urban than in rural countries.},

Results show that elasticities of demand for food at home and food away from home vary widely across different groups of consumers defined by a priori cluster analysis based on demographic and attitudinal variables. Results from a choice experiment are found to depend on when the experiment was conducted and on the market prices prevailing at the time of the survey. Given the large sample of consumers observed over time, there is sufficient data to demographically characterize a small portion of the population-vegetarians-using traditional logit models and a machine learning method - a classifications tree.},

abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis of food and agricultural demand elasticities for China, and used the results to derive estimates of income, own-price, and cross-price elasticities of demand that can be used in models of food and agricultural markets. Consistent with expectations, we find that income elasticities of demand for many food products decline as per capita income increases. The declines are relatively large for alcohol and tobacco, and smaller for livestock products. Contrary to expectations, own-price elasticities for some products become more price-elastic as per capita income increases. One explanation may be that economic development brings with it improvements in food supply chains that provide people more choices with respect to food products than those traditionally consumed in rural villages, leading to greater substitution possibilities and more price-elastic demands. Estimates for 2011 of income and own-price demand elasticities are generally reasonable, whereas deriving reliable estimates of cross-price elasticities is difficult. The estimates suggest that China's meat and dairy demands, and in turn livestock feed demands, will continue growing strongly. Policy-makers should continue to monitor the evolution of demand for these products with an eye toward ensuring food security, particularly given the sheer size of the population and relatively tight domestic food supply situation in China.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017. All rights reserved. The landing obligation policy was one of the major innovations introduced in the last Common Fisheries Policy reform in Europe. It is foreseen that the policy will affect the use of fishing opportunities and hence the economic performance of the fleets. The problem with fishing opportunities could be solved if single-stock total allowable catches (TACs) could be achieved simultaneously for all the stocks. In this study, we evaluate the economic impact of the landing obligation policy on the Spanish demersal fleet operating in the Iberian Sea region. To generate TAC advice, we used two sets of maximumsustainable yield (MSY) reference points, the single-stockMSY reference points defined by ICES and a set ofmultistock reference points calculated simultaneously using a bioeconomic optimization model. Wefound that the impact of the landing obligation is time and fleet dependent and highly influenced by assumptions about fleet dynamics. At fishery level, multistock reference points mitigate the decrease in the net present value generated by the implementation of the landing obligation. However at fleet level, the effect depends on the fleet itself and the period. To ensure the optimum use of fishing opportunities, the landing obligation should be accompanied by a management system that guarantees consistency between single-stock TACs. In this regard, multistock reference points represent an improvement over those currently in use. However, further investigation is necessary to enhance performance both at fleet level and in the long term.},

" The staggered introductions of catch shares in the Alaska pollock and Pacific hake fisheries—neighboring regional fisheries that are the largest and sixth largest fishery by volume in the United States, respectively—provide a unique natural experiment for isolating the impact of " catch shares. " Difference-in-difference-in-differences estimations, combined with vessel fixed effects, indicate that catch shares are associated with an increase in the number of days that a harvester spends at sea engaging in fishing activities, which implies a slowing of fishing effort, ceteris paribus. For the Pacific hake fishery, participation in the pollock fishery is a negative predictor of a harvester's days at sea in the target fishery. In the initial two years when the hake fishery was rationalized before the pollock fishery the pollock fishery served as a derby alternative for hake harvesters. Results also show that pollock and hake harvesters re-spond to changing economic conditions: fish or fish product prices are positive predic-tors of days at sea. For the Pacific hake catcher-processor fleet, an estimated increase in days at sea per ton of catch suggests that a harvester's fishing intensity has also slowed as a result of catch shares.},

Research on valuation is expected to remain vigorous, primarily in the testing of basic assumptions and reconciliation of existing inconsistencies. Opportunities in renewable resource economics center on the incorporation of richer behavioral and technological detail in the general frameworks that already exist. A better understanding of what drives technology, and how environmental agreements can be negotiated and enforced among sovereign nations, are two topics likely to shape future research on global externalities.

Unfortunately, actual water markets, including those in developed countries, usually fall far short of this ideal. The paper considers the allocation of water by markets that are only imperfectly developed, in which prices are not publicly known and in which there is no centralized trading location. These limitations impose transaction costs on buyers and sellers, that is costs associated with completing a transaction. A conceptual model of the effect of transaction costs on trading patterns is developed. Stylized results are tested using data from an informal water market in California. The paper concludes with a description of the importance of transaction costs, comments on the transition to more formal water markets, and policy recommendations.},

abstract = {All fisheries-management models incorporate simplifying assumptions about ecologi-cal and oceanographic mechanisms that are fundamentally uncertain or stochastic, but exploited fisheries are also subject to equally important uncertainties associated with fisherman behavior. Fishermen make decisions ranging from long-term entry/exit deci-sions to daily or even hourly decisions about where and how to fish. These decisions are influenced by regulations, technology, weather, and expectations about prices, costs, and abundance. They ultimately determine the spatial and temporal pattern of mortality in an exploited fishery. Although biologists have tried to incorporate fisherman behavior into management models, much of the work is ad hoc, whereas economics has a rich tradition of both conceptual and empirical behavioral modeling. This paper is an attempt to dem-onstrate the potential usefulness of economics-based behavioral modeling, with data col-lected for biological management. A model of participation and spatial choice is con-structed, and the economic model is linked to a biological model of metapopulation dy-namics and used to forecast the implications of management measures that might be applied to the red sea urchin fishery in California. The results show that modeling spatial behavior strongly affects the predicted outcomes of management policies even if the policies are not spatial in character. Over the past two decades, prominent fisheries scientists have increasingly criticized conventional fisheries-management methods (cf Ludwig et al., 1993; Walters and Parma, 1996; Pitcher et al., 1998;). The standard argument supporting the critique is that fisher-ies populations are stochastic, patchy, and heterogeneous and are linked with highly un-predictable oceanographic processes including upwelling, currents, and wind. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio in commonly collected assessment data is low and simply not good enough to track variation in populations as it unfolds in a manner that might make it useful for immediate decisions. Under this modern view, attempting to pursue anything like a fishery-wide maximum-sustainable-yield policy by measuring and estimating stable yield functions and computing optimal harvests for such a complicated system is simply folly. Under the presumption that these criticisms and alternative depictions of marine eco-systems are correct, what kinds of policies and management strategies are appropriate? A consensus is beginning to emerge that new policies must be spatially explicit, reflecting the patchiness of real systems, the heterogeneity of productivity and other life-cycle fac-tors over space, and the kinds and character of mechanisms that link various elements of metapopulations (cf Walters, 1998, 2000). Although it is not clear what kinds of policies ought to replace old ones under these circumstances, one special subset of policy options that has received the most attention is the option of marine reserves (cf Coleman and Travis, 2000). The thinking of many is that protected zones can provide near fool-proof insurance against various measurement errors, management errors, or other stochastic events by providing sources for repopulation of local populations temporarily depleted by management mistakes or by the inability to set and enforce harvest targets accurately},

abstract = {During the past half-century notable changes have occurred in the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). To understand how the system functions as a whole, to evaluate the potential responses of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations, and to elucidate the relative magnitude of key biota and processes, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center instituted the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to establish an ecological network model (i.e., a more nuanced energy budget) of the entire Northeast U.S. food web. The EMAX work focused on the interdisciplinary development of a network model which reflected contemporary conditions (1996–2000) in four major regions of the ecosystem:, Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England and Middle Atlantic Bight. The model had 36 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of the biological hierarchy within each trophic level and incorporated a wide range of key rate processes. Because this ecosystem has been relatively well studied many of the biomass estimates were based on field measurements and biomass estimates from the scientific literature were required only for a relatively small number of nodes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes in the ecosystem. Our results show that small pelagic fishes are indeed keystone species in the ecosystem. We examined a suite of novel ecosystem metrics as we compared the four regions and provided a general, system-level description of the NEUS ecosystem. The general patterns of the network properties in the four regions were similar; however the network indices and metrics did reveal some noteworthy differences among regions reflecting their different oceanographic and faunal characteristics. The process of compiling and evaluating available data required by an ecosystem network model identified important gaps in our understanding which should be addressed during future ecosystem surveys. Moreover, exercises like EMAX will be a valuable starting point as we continue to progress towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM).},

abstract = {This paper has a twofold objective: First, to estimate the changes in landings value by 2030 for two Mexican coastal fisheries, specifically shrimp and sardine fisheries, as a consequence of climate change; and second, to discuss the implications of such impacts for food security. A dynamic panel model was used for the Mexican fisheries sector, with data from 1990 through 2009. The results suggest that shrimp production will be negatively affected, while in contrast, the sardine fishery is expected to benefit from the increase in temperature. Most losses/gains would be observed in the NW Mexican Pacific, where the fishing sector has an important role in the local economy, representing a risk to food security in both direct and indirect ways.},

abstract = {Climate change and decadal variability are impacting marine fish and invertebrate species worldwide and these impacts will continue for the foreseeable future. Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.},

abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of fishermen is a key ingredient to successful fisheries management. The aggregate behaviour of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race-for-fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done - per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is the process of using simulation testing with feedback to examine the robustness of candidate management strategies to error and uncertainty. The structure of the management strategy can be selected to attempt to satisfy desired (but conflicting) management objectives. MSE was used to assess the performance of the current management strategy and an alternative management strategy (the “dynamic B0” strategy) for the fishery for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), when age-1 recruitment was driven by climate. The relationships between age-1 abundance and climate indices (and the uncertainties associated with these relationships) were characterized within an age-structured operating model that was fitted to the data for GOA walleye pollock. Projections into the future were based on the fitted relationships and predictions of those indices from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models, using the current or the alternative management strategy to determine catch limits. Management performance (the ability to leave the stock close to the management reference level and achieve high and stable catches) deteriorated when age-1 recruitment was forced by climate, although stocks were kept near the reference level on average. In addition, the ability to estimate management-related quantities, such as spawning biomass, deteriorated markedly when recruitment was forced by climate. Performance was sensitive to the choice of IPCC dataset and, in particular, estimation and management performance was poorest (outcomes most variable) for the IPCC datasets that led to the greatest variation in recruitment to the fishery. Although basing management on a “dynamic B0” management strategy led to improved management and estimation performance, the magnitude of the improvement was slight.},

abstract = {Increasingly, economists and ecologists have begun to recognize the value to public policy of combining information and results from each discipline into multidisciplinary studies. Here, we present a methodological approach that links economic and ecological analyses. We develop an economic-ecological model by merging an input-output model of a coastal economy with a model of a marine food web. We describe distinct linear system sub-models of the economy and the ecosystem, and we develop a method for linking the two. Our method extends the work of earlier researchers by incorporating an ecosystem matrix into resource multipliers, and by showing how these multipliers may be calculated. We present a numerical example for the New England region using coastal economic and marine ecological data from the region for a restricted set of industry sectors and food web trophic levels. We calculate resource multipliers for the example, and we simulate the economic impacts of changes in primary production in the ecosystem on final demands for fishery products. The results illustrate the effects of incorporating the impacts of habitat destruction and ecosystem structure on resource multipliers. Our approach can be extended to incorporate the full range of sectors in the economy and trophic levels in a linked ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The initial effort function is translog but tests suggest that the CES form cannot be rejected. The vessel's choice of fishing ground is modeled by a probit equation, the output from which is included in the OLS estimation of the production function. The elasticity of substitution between the inputs which are restricted by regulation and the other inputs is of particular interest as it determines whether input restriction is an efficient form of regulation for the fishery.

abstract = {After 16 years under a limited access program with effort controls, the New England groundfish fishery transitioned to a catch share management system in 2010. For much of its earlier management history, issues related to fishing capacity were paramount as effort controls were increasingly restrictive to meet biological objectives. As the size of the active fleet declined from over 1000 vessels from 1994 to 2001 to less than 400 vessels in 2012, the management concern shifted to fleet diversity. Fleet diversity has been cast in terms of vessels based on characteristics such as size, gear, and region rather than their share in landings or economic value. Measuring fleet diversity with indices commonly used in the biodiversity literature such as richness, effective diversity based on the Shannon index, and evenness appears appropriate for this context. In this paper these indices were applied to measure changes in diversity of the active New England groundfish fleet from 1996 to 2012. Fleet diversity as measured by the Shannon Index has declined by approximately 35{\%} from 1996 to 2012, but has remained relatively stable since 2007. Forty vessel types were present in all 17 years, which accounted for about 85{\%} of active groundfish vessels and over 90{\%} of total groundfish landings in all years. Even though the fleet size and overall diversity have declined the "core" groundfish fleet remains stable.},

The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boost-ing school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school partic-ipation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.},

Our results emphasize the difficulty of assessing the potential impacts of a policy change on the basis of ex ante data alone. Since such data are generated under a different incentive structure than the prospective system, a purely empirical approach imposed upon a flexible functional form is likely to reflect far more about the incentives under status-quo management than the actual technological possibilities under a new policy regime.},

abstract = {The susceptibility to fishing of the populations of 13 sea snake species caught as bycatch by trawlers in Australia's Northern Prawn (shrimp) Fishery (NPF) was examined to identify species at potential risk that should become priority for research and management. Each species was assessed according to two groups of criteria - (1) their relative vulnerability to capture by prawn trawling and (2) the relative capacity of their populations to sustain increased mortality due to fishing. Within each group, each species was ranked (1-3) on individual criteria reflecting distribution, catch rates, habitat selection, activity patterns, reproductive biology and survival. These criteria were then weighted according to their relative importance. The mean weighted ranks of each species for the two groups of criteria were plotted and zones of relative priority were identified Only one species, Hydrophis pacificus, fell into the high-priority category, being both highly vulnerable to trawling and having a poor capacity to sustain fishing mortality. However, this species has been very rare in prawn trawl catches for at least 10 years, making it difficult to assess any temporal or spatial changes in catch. Among the species of moderate priority, two large, bulky species - Aipysurus laevis and Astrotia stokesii - had the poorest capacity to sustain fishing mortality of any of the species examined and would become a research and management priority if the percentage of the population vulnerable to capture increased. New fisheries management changes to (1) reduce effective fishing effort and (2) reduce bycatch by inclusion of Turtle Excluder Devices that take effect in 2000 are both expected to reduce the susceptibility of sea snakes to trawling in the NPF. Further studies to better, estimate the sizes of sea snake populations and model natural and fishery processes will help clarify if populations of the most susceptible species are indeed at risk. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Imposing the Spanish household structure to the U.S. wealth distribution has little effect on the Gini coefficient and wealth top shares. However, this is the net result of reduced differences at the bottom and increased differences at the top. So there is distinct additional information in considering the whole distribution. Finally, we present results for the within-group differences between the two countries using quantile regressions and find a reversing pattern by age. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

SNF Working Paper No. 37/05 2 ABSTRACT During the last decades, there has been virtually an explosion in the number of studies of the demand structure for seafood markets. The most common approach is demand analysis, where demand equations are estimated either individually or in a system of demand equations. These studies of the demand structure focus on the price sensitivity of demand, on the degree of substitution between potentially competing products and on income/expenditure effects. However, as price information is often more available than quantity, there have been a number of market integration studies that primarily focus on the competition between different products. The purpose of this paper is to give a review of demand and market integration studies with respect to fish, focusing on the method used, the information that is obtained, and how this information varies with the approach used.},

In this paper, the duration of trade relationships for Norwegian export firms to various markets is investigated for six product forms of one commodity, cod. The results indicate that the duration of most trade relationships is very short, and shorter than what is normally reported in the literature. Still, the substantial variation in duration by product form and factors influencing it, indicates heterogeneous dynamics for each supply chain even for slight differences in the characteristics of a commodity. Moreover, the short duration of trade relationships in the supply chains for Norwegian cod indicates that they remain very traditional food supply chains, with few attempts at reducing transaction costs through vertical coordination or relationships.},

This leads to results that are significantly different from those obtained from single cross-country regressions.

We consider four common estimators--nonspatial OLS, spatial OLS, spatial 2SLS, and spatial ML. We examine analytically the respective omitted-variable and simultaneity biases of nonspatial OLS and spatial OLS in the simplest case and then evaluate the performance of all four estimators in bias, efficiency, and SE accuracy terms under more realistic conditions using Monte Carlo experiments. We provide empirical illustration, showing how to calculate and present spatial effect estimates effectively, using data on European governments' active labor market expenditures. Our main conclusions are that spatial OLS, despite its simultaneity, performs acceptably under low-to-moderate interdependence strength and reasonable sample dimensions. Spatial 2SLS or spatial ML may be advised for other conditions, but, unless interdependence is truly absent or minuscule, any of the spatial estimators unambiguously, and often dramatically, dominates on all three criteria the nonspatial OLS commonly used currently in empirical work in political science.},

However, harvester decisions impact the economic performance of co-dependent processing firms. This paper incorporates both sectors in an analysis of the effect of ITQs on commercial fisheries. Results show that, as a consequence of season elongation under a harvester-only allocation of fishing rights, capital nonmalleability implies that processor quasi-rents will be redistributed to harvesters. These losses could promote political gridlock and jeopardize adoption of an ITQ policy unless they are fully compensated or unless redistribution is avoided by a policy-superior initial allocation of rights to both harvesters and processors.},

abstract = {Obtaining accurate data on abundance is vital to undertaking viable stock assessments of commercially exploited species. Satellite Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMSs) combined with fisheries logbooks have the potential to provide an abundant source of data with greater spatial and temporal coverage than research surveys. However, to date it has not been demonstrated how well VMS-derived abundance or biomass indices reflect research survey results. In this study we compared biomass indices of scallops derived from (i) fishing vessel surveys, (ii) research vessel surveys, and (iii) fishery-dependent data using VMSs and logbooks. In most cases there were strong relationships between biomass indices of Pecten maximus from fishing vessels and the research vessel. There were stronger relationships between P. maximus biomass indices from fishery-dependent VMS and logbook data and research vessel data at the beginning of the fishing season, when abundance was higher, but weaker relationships at the end of the fishing season. The time and location of sampling affected biomass estimates over short periods, and without standardizing to location and vessel, biomass depletion was masked. Fishery-dependent data provides a valid means of assessing relative scallop abundance and may prove equally viable in other fisheries with appropriate standardization of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data, making real-time management of fisheries increasingly feasible.},

In a study of all major United States federal catch share fisheries and associated shared stock fisheries in British Columbia, catch shares result in environmental improvements, economic improvements, and a mixture of changes in social performance, relative to the race for fish under traditional management. Environmentally, compliance with total allowable catch increases and discards decrease. Economically, vessel yields rise, total revenues grow, and long-term stock increases are encouraged. Socially, safety increases, some port areas modestly consolidate, needed processing capacity often reduces, and labor markets shift from part time jobs to full time jobs with similar total employment. Newer catch shares address many social concerns through careful design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biomass and commercial catch rates of Atlantic sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus in the
USA generally declined from the 1960s through the mid-1990s as fishing mortality increased. Sporadic large recruitment events temporarily increased landings but also encouraged higher overall fishing effort and thereby contributed to the long-term declines in resource abundance. In 1994, a number of new management measures were introduced, including a moratorium on new permits, limitations on days at sea, gear and crew restrictions, and year-round closed areas. During 1994–2005, the biomass of sea scallops in the U.S. sector of
Georges Bank increased by a factor of about 18, while the biomass of sea scallops in the Middle Atlantic
Bight increased by about eight times. These increases were primarily due to the area closures. Biomass in the
Georges Bank closed areas was 25 times higher in 2005 than in 1994, and the 2005 level constituted over 80{\%}
of the biomass in the U.S. portion of Georges Bank. Substantial increases in sea scallop abundance and
biomass also occurred in two of the three areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight that were closed rotationally to
sea scallop fishing for 3 years. Mean recruitment on Georges Bank did not significantly increase since the
closures there, but very strong recruitment has been observed downstream of one of the mid-Atlantic
rotational closures. In the open areas, responses to effort reduction measures were minimal until 1999, but
biomass, commercial catch rates, and landings substantially increased during 1999–2005 due to effort controls
and increased recruitment in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The recovery of U.S. sea scallop populations
demonstrates that the combination of effort controls and area management can rapidly rebuild severely
depleted fisheries.},

Using both actual data and simulations, we explored two approaches to the stock assessment of Georges Bank Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus), where fishery closures were implemented in December 1994. One approach modeled the stock in " aggregate" , using domed commercial selectivity functions for the time periods when the MPAs were closed to scallop fishing. In the second " split" approach, separate models were used for the scallops inside (closed areas) and outside (open areas) the MPAs. The aggregate model converged only in 17{\%} of the simulated runs, compared with 93{\%} convergence for the open and closed runs using the split approach. With actual data, and in those simulations where both methods converged, the two approaches gave similar results, although biomass estimates in the most recent years from the aggregate model tended to be biased low. The closed area model, and to a lesser extent the aggregate model, estimated natural mortality M fairly precisely, but open area model estimates of M were poorly defined. Retrospective patterns were reduced using the split approach and when natural mortality was estimated. We conclude that the split assessment approach is better for sea scallops, but it may be best to use both approaches for comparative purposes. ?? 2012 .},

The aim of this paper is to characterize and measure the demand structure for imported cod products to Portugal. A PCAIDS model is used to identify and measure own-and cross-price elasticities of demand for frozen, salted and salted {\&} dried cod products. The calcu-lated elasticities of demand are then used in combination with a demand growth index model to measure shifts in demand impacting price of product. Controlling for supply shocks the growth index shows over the period a positive growth in demand for frozen product but a negative change in demand growth for salted, and to a lesser degree, for salted {\&} dried products. The results are used in simulating alternative price demand scenarios.},

The bioeconomic system is depicted with a metapopulation model where the subpopulations are connected by dispersal processes and are affected by the spatial distribution of harvesting effort. We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort, harvesting, and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal. Using a simple parameterization to explore qualitative properties in several specific examples, we find that second-best solutions blend or average results of the differentiated case and differ in intuitive ways from first-best optima. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A major challenge in current systems biology is the combination and integrative analysis of large data sets obtained from different high-throughput omics platforms, such as mass spectrometry based Metabolomics and Proteomics or DNA microarray or RNA-seq-based Transcriptomics. Especially in the case of non-targeted Metabolomics experiments, where it is often impossible to unambiguously map ion features from mass spectrometry analysis to metabolites, the integration of more reliable omics technologies is highly desirable. A popular method for the knowledge-based interpretation of single data sets is the (Gene) Set Enrichment Analysis. In order to combine the results from different analyses, we introduce a methodical framework for the meta-analysis of p-values obtained from Pathway Enrichment Analysis (Set Enrichment Analysis based on pathways) of multiple dependent or independent data sets from different omics platforms. For dependent data sets, e.g. obtained from the same biological samples, the framework utilizes a covariance estimation procedure based on the nonsignificant pathways in single data set enrichment analysis. The framework is evaluated and applied in the joint analysis of Metabolomics mass spectrometry and Transcriptomics DNA microarray data in the context of plant wounding. In extensive studies of simulated data set dependence, the introduced correlation could be fully reconstructed by means of the covariance estimation based on pathway enrichment. By restricting the range of p-values of pathways considered in the estimation, the overestimation of correlation, which is introduced by the significant pathways, could be reduced. When applying the proposed methods to the real data sets, the meta-analysis was shown not only to be a powerful tool to investigate the correlation between different data sets and summarize the results of multiple analyses but also to distinguish experiment-specific key pathways.},

An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomeration extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.},

A two-step, limited information maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to fill this gap. The estimator is developed assuming a Poisson distribution, but can be extended to other count distributions. The small sample properties of the estimator are evaluated with Monte Carlo experiments. Simulation results suggest that the spatial lag count estimator achieves gains in terms of bias over the aspatial version as spatial lag autocorrelation and sample size increase. An empirical example deals with the location choice of single-unit start-up firms in the manufacturing industry in the US between 2000 and 2004. The empirical results suggest that in the dynamic process of firm formation, counties dominated by firms exhibiting internal increasing returns to scale are at a relative disadvantage even if localization economies are present. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Many businesses and communities were still struggling, due to heavy infrastructure damages and revenue losses with low insurance coverage, but also to disrupted fishing patterns for some species. Social bonds were credited by many as a key aid to recovery. Social bonds (sometimes called bonding social capital) have been shown to be critical for evacuation and recovery in other disasters.

The social planner's problem in this model is to maximize the discounted social benefit from consumption of a homogeneous resource under the constraint that cumulative consumption is no greater than the initial resource stock. The marginal resource rent for the optimal extraction path grows at the real rate of interest, and the equilibrium resource price meets this condition, known as “Hotelling's rule”. This rule modifies under the model extensions to heterogeneous resources: the marginal rent falls if extraction switches from low-cost to high-cost resource stocks. We consider the models of resource pricing in the presence of a backstop technology, the Herfindahl principle that a lower-cost resource stock depletes before extraction switches to a higher-cost stock, and the principle of comparative advantage for a more general case of heterogeneous resources and consumers.},

@article{Clay2014,
abstract = {In May 2010 the New England Fishery Management Council introduced a catch share, program in the Northeast Multispecies (groundfish) Fishery. Amendment 16 of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan allocated quota to 17 self organized groups of permit holders based on their collective catch history. These groups are commonly referred to as Sectors and are similar to harvest cooperatives. Sectors represented a significant shift from previous management approaches reliant on limits to days at sea and other input controls. Given the potential for significant social and economic effects of catch shares and other management programs, social and economic performance measures were developed from 2009 to 2010 by Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) social scientists. Previous social and economic monitoring of management outcomes had been ad hoc and provided minimal opportunity for inter-fishery comparison. This paper describes the process of identifying performance measures and associated indicators to serve as the foundation of monitoring social and economic outcomes for all federal fisheries in the U.S. Northeast Region, and for planning NEFSC social and economic research priorities. It then presents how these performance measures were applied to assess the first year of the Amendment 16 Sector program. Challenges and limitations of this process are presented along with a description of efforts underway to broaden the use of these social and economic metrics to other fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@techreport{Palmer2017,
abstract = {Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan was implemented in May 2010 and brought about many changes in the management of the Northeast United States groundfish fishery. Among the changes was a shift from an input control system (days-at-sea, trip limits, etc.) to a quota based catch-share system with each vessel and harvest cooperative accountable for its total catch (landings and discards). This quota-based system could have created incentives to intentionally misreport catch along these lines, particularly for stocks where quota was limited. This possibility of incentives would be particularly true for allocated groundfish species managed as multiple stocks (Atlantic cod [Gadus morhua], haddock [Melanogrammus aeglefinus], yellowtail flounder [Limanda ferruginea], and winter flounder [Pseudopleuronectes americanus]).For these four stocks, catches of lower quota stocks of the same species could be reported in another stock area where quota was less limiting by either inaccurately reporting the fishing area or catch location on the vessel trip report (VTR). Accurate reporting is critical to ensuring that fishery removals are managed appropriately and that fish stocks are not overharvested. Vessel monitoring system (VMS) positional data were used to validate the statistical area fished and stock apportionment of allocated groundfish landings derived from mandatory VTRs for the period January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2016 (covers fishing years 2008 to 2015) to examine whether changes in reporting patterns occurred after the transition to the catch-share system. Additionally, the relative amount of stock-level catch reporting errors was estimated from the differences between the VMS-based method and reported VTR landings. While the VMS methods can be imprecise, they are useful for detecting shifts in reporting patterns over time and estimating the general scale of the errors. Results show the difference in VMS estimated catch and VTR reported catch changing markedly beginning in fishing year 2010 for several of the quota-limited stocks. These discrepancies occurred despite marginal improvements in compliance with VTR area fished reporting requirements over the same time period. For the majority of the stocks examined, the overall error is estimated to be small and may not substantially impact resource monitoring and stock assessment efforts; however for some stocks the estimated errors are large in one or more years (Eastern Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine cod, Gulf of Maine haddock, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder). While the impacts on some stocks may be large, the magnitude in terms of number of vessels contributing to the overall error is small. Much of the error could be mitigated through improvements in catch monitoring and/or management measures designed to improve catch accounting.},

Special attention is given to how that distribution was affected by a federal policy to improve fishery efficiency through a program to buyback limited-entry groundfish trawl permits. The findings indicate that programs that promote efficiency may also affect where fish are landed. The 2003 buyback was found to have an effect on the geographic distribution of landings by reducing the geographic dispersion of industry participants. This shift in landings is likely to have economic impacts on communities where landings are reduced though upstream and downstream third party impacts.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quota (ITQ) markets are being used successfully to distribute quotas in single region and single species fisheries. In many parts of the world, the development of well crafted markets for multispecies or multiregional fisheries is still evolving. As a result, there exists an opportunity to inform policy by providing research insights into the relative merits of alternative market designs for such fisheries. This study explored the relative merits of a simultaneous ascending auction design and an iterative combinatorial auction design for a hypothetical multiple region quota market. In a simultaneous auction, separate auctions are run in parallel for individual species or regions. During intermediate rounds, fishers can adjust their bids in auction depending on their position in the other auction. In a combinatorial auction, a fisher can purchase a combination of quotas (or a package quota) for different fish species or regions in the same auction. Being able to acquire bundles of species or regions allows fishers to take advantage of complementarities. To date, the potentials of such auctions have not been thoroughly tested in fisheries quota markets. This study found that while a simultaneous auction design was more efficient than combinatorial auction design overall, combinatorial market design took fewer rounds to make final allocations and performed better in high synergy environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We developed a standardized methodology to define factors influencing effort allocation and to produce fishing effort maps by merging GIS with geostatistical modelling techniques. Results revealed that in most cases the factors "distance to the no-take", "water depth", and "distance to the port" had a significant influence on effort allocation by the fishing fleets. Overall, we found local concentration of fishing effort around the MPA borders. Thus, neglecting the pattern of fishing effort distribution in evaluating MPA benefits, such as spillover of biomass, could hamper sound interpretation of MPAs as fisheries management tools.},

In his seminal work on common property resources, H. Scott Gordon proposed that in a fishery with multiple grounds, effort would be distributed such that profit rates would be equal among them. Gordon's model relies on implicit assumptions that are inaccurate and lead to false conclusions in many cases.

We find that cross-country income mobility comparisons largely depend on the type of indices used. The relative positions of the countries considered change when the analysis is based on ethical instead of objective measures of income mobility. Results also show that in most countries income growth has a very limited effect upon aggregate mobility, being the most important determinant the rerankings of individuals, with a little weight for inequality changes. Although some common results exist concerning the delimitation of groups experiencing the greatest income fluctuations, such as individuals belonging to single-parent households or young household heads, the intensity of these results varies greatly across countries.

abstract = {Can a perishable food commodity with strong seasonal variation in supply, supplied by producers with limited operational radius, belong to a spatially integrated market? The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.},

abstract = {In the northeast United States, groundfish landings have declined almost continually since 1983. Fresh groundfish processors have redeployed their marketing capital by substituting other seafood products in place of regional groundfish and expanding into different markets. Meanwhile, northeast U.S. Atlantic sea scallop landings sharply increased starting in 1998, peaked in 2004, remained relatively constant until declining in 2013 and 2014. In order to leverage their favorable access to increased landings, scallop processors invested in development of new products, such as individually quick frozen (IQF) scallops, and invested in marketing activities to attract new customers, including those located in foreign nations. This behavior is consistent with Montgomery and Wernerfelt's theory of diversification in response to excess capacity of firm-specific resources and investments in product development and marketing in firm specific resources. Price and quantity indicators were used to examine the effects of shifting landings and composition of landings on exvessel values. These indicators show that declines in groundfish exvessel values were driven by declining quantities, which is consistent with processors substituting other products rather than biding up exvessel prices. Increases in scallop exvessel values were driven by both increasing prices for all sizes and by increasing quantities for large scallops, which is consistent with investment in marketing for larger scallops.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that skippers can have a significant role in their vessel performance levels. However, in many studies that seek to ad-dress differences in performance of vessels, the contribution of the skipper is often not quantified, or the influencing factors are not explained. This study examines the effect of social factors, such as family heritage, education and professional expertise, on skipper skill and the eco-nomic performance of the Portuguese artisanal dredge fleet. This is done using a stochastic production frontier model and data on the weekly activity of 54 vessels operating during 2013 and 2014. The results suggest that in this fishery age and education levels of skippers are impor-tant determinants of efficiency. Experience as a skipper was no determinant of performance, possibly due to the simplicity of the technical equipment onboard. From a managerial perspective, this indicates that local authorities should consider initiatives to enhance the education levels and professional training of skippers, if they aim to improve the effectiveness of artisanal fleets.},

We compare patterns under these two institutions and study how the differences in the patterns generated by these two institutions impact the design of regulatory schemes to internalize the externalities. At the same time we introduce new methods based on Fourier series type decompositions that enable us to turn an intractable infinite dimensional optimal control problem into a countable number of finite dimensional optimal control problems. As far as we know these methods are new to the economics literature. Our theory is applied to the management and regulation of a semi-arid system.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification, the progressive change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric CO2, is likely to affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports one of the most economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U.S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under RCP 8.5 CO2 emissions and current harvest rules, assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth. Future work will explore different economic and management scenarios and test how potential impacts of ocean acidification on other scallop biological parameters may influence the social-ecological system. Future empirical work on the effect of ocean acidification on sea scallops is also needed.},

abstract = {Despite decades of discussion and implementation, conservation monitoring remains a challenge. Many current solutions in the literature focus on improving the science or making more structured decisions. These insights are important but incomplete in accounting for the politics and economics of the conservation decisions informed by monitoring. Our novel depiction of the monitoring enterprise unifies insights from multiple disciplines (conservation, operations research, economics, and policy) and highlights many underappreciated factors that affect the expected benefits of monitoring. For example, there must be a strong link between the specific needs of decision makers and information gathering. Furthermore, the involvement of stakeholders other than scientists and research managers means that new information may not be interpreted and acted upon as expected. While answering calls for sharply delineated objectives will clearly add focus to monitoring efforts, for practical reasons, high-level goals may purposefully be left vague, to facilitate other necessary steps in the policy process. We use the expanded depiction of the monitoring process to highlight problems of cooperation and conflict. We critique calls to invest in monitoring for the greater good by arguing that incentives are typically lacking. Although the benefits of learning accrued within a project (e.g., improving management) provide incentives for investing in some monitoring, it is unrealistic, in general, to expect managers to add potentially costly measures to generate shared benefits. In the traditional linear model of the role of science in policy decisions, monitoring reduces uncertainty and decision makers are rational, unbiased consumers of the science. However, conservation actions increasingly involve social conflict. Drawing insights from political science, we argue that in high-conflict situations, it is necessary to address the conflict prior to monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly proposed as a fisheries management tool besides their conservation purposes. When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protection, the dynamics of fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should be analyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, therefore compromising an understanding of fishers' preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishing grounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures. To fulfil this gap, here we assess the spatial and seasonal fishers' preferences from local artisanal fisheries (nets, traps, jigs and longlines) before the implementation of a MPA management plan (the Arr{\'{a}}bida Marine Park, Portugal). Zero inflated modelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the main drivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely related to the distribution of target species and associated habitats. Proximity to port, weather conditions and distance to coast are also important factors influencing, in different ways, these artisanal fisheries. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics of the distribution of artisanal fisheries operating multiple-gears and targeting multiple-species and are likely transferable to many coastal multiple-use MPAs where no baseline data exist. Moreover, the variety of responses and preferences found between gears and fishers before the establishment of zoning are important to understand the dynamics of local fisheries, to contribute to an ecosystem-based management and to improve both conservation and fisheries management decisions. Our study is one of the few characterizing fisheries dynamics and fishers' preferences before protection measures are implemented providing important lessons to the management of coastal fisheries where artisanal fisheries prevail. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In multi-species fisheries managed under ITQs, the existence of joint production may lead to complex catch-quota balancing issues. Previous modelling and experimental research suggest that, in such fisheries, some fishers may benefit from the ability to trade packages of fishing quotas, rather than fulfil their quota needs by simultaneously bidding on separate single-species quota markets. This note presents evidence of naturally occurring package trades in a real fishery. Based on this evidence, we suggest that further empirical and modelling research is required on the potential and limitations of package quota trading in mixed fisheries managed with ITQs. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Essington, T. E., and Plag{\'{a}}nyi, {\'{E}}. E. Pitfalls and guidelines for “recycling” models for ecosystem-based fisheries management. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71: . Ecosystem models have been developed for many marine systems to provide guidance on fisheries management strategies that protect key ecological functions. These models are commonly “recycled”, i.e. applied to new questions or policy concerns after the initial phase of model development, testing, and application. Because decisions about the model structure are typically based on the intended model use, it is important to recognize limits in the capacity of models to address questions for which they were not specifically designed. Here, we evaluate existing foodweb models in the context of their ability to identify key forage species in foodwebs and to test management strategies for fisheries that target them. We find that the depth and breadth with which predator species are represented are commonly insufficient for evaluating sensitivities of predator populations to forage fish depletion. We demonstrate that aggregating predator species into functional groups creates bias in foodweb metrics such as connectance. Models also varied considerably with respect to the extent that they have been tuned or fitted to retrospective patterns and the degree to which key sensitivities are identified. We use this case study to provide several general recommendations when “recycling” ecosystem and foodweb models. Briefly, we suggest as routine procedure careful scrutiny of structural model attributes, of scales at which ecological processes are included, and quality of fits for key functional groups.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been widely proposed as a fisheries management tool in addition to their conservation purposes. Despite this, few studies have satisfactorily assessed the dynamics of fishers' adaptations to the loss of fishing grounds. Here we used data from before, during and after the implementation of the management plan of a temperate Atlantic multiple-use MPA to examine the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of different gears used by the artisanal fishing fleet. The position of vessels and gear types were obtained by visual surveys and related to spatial features of the marine park. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify heavily utilized patches for each fishing gear and time period. The contribution of individual vessels to each significant cluster was assessed to better understand fishers' choices. Different fisheries responded differently to the implementation of protection measures, with preferred habitats of target species driving much of the fishers' choices. Within each fishery, individual fishers showed distinct strategies with some operating in a broader area whereas others kept preferred territories. Our findings are based on reliable methods that can easily be applied in coastal multipurpose MPAs to monitor and assess fisheries and fishers responses to different management rules and protection levels. This paper is the first in-depth empirical study where fishers' choices from artisanal fisheries were analysed before, during and after the implementation of a MPA, thereby allowing a clearer understanding of the dynamics of local fisheries and providing significant lessons for marine conservation and management of coastal systems.},

The paper discusses the stochastic aspects of share definition and measurement, and summarizes important features of the existing literature on econometric strategies for share model estimation. The paper then goes on to discuss the univariate fractional regression estimation strategies proposed by Papke and Wooldridge and to extend the fractional regression approach to estimation of and inference about regression models describing the multivariate share data. Some issues involving outcome aggregation/ disaggregation are considered, as is a full likelihood estimation approach based on Dirichlet-multinomial models.

This is concomitant with a move towards ecosystem-based management that also partakes in a policy environment imbued with the commodification of nature, in which environmental services are ranked and valued according to neoliberal percepts. Crucial to these projects are the utilization of GIS technologies. This paper considers these zones of preservation and sites of conflict through an ethnographic case study of the scallop fisheries of New England, examining conflicts between harvesters, different projects to map the fishery, and ongoing efforts to reseed scallop beds. The paper explores how participants themselves articulate the changing practices of fishing and farming, redefining boundaries of nature and culture. While reseeding projects, for example, arguably participate in the market logic of neoliberalism, at the same time they may resist and redefine the terms, as communities see themselves sowing the seeds of their own sustainability and changing the terms of what counts, literally, as nature.},

These regulations have generated a sizable economics literature focused on the spatial behavior of fishermen. Fundamental to these studies is the consideration set (spatial alternatives) assumed by the researcher to be possessed by the decision agent. Often times this consideration set is assumed to be the entire spatial extent of the fishery. This research proposes the use of finite mixture modeling to endogenously estimate the formation of consideration sets and the method is applied to a unique spatial decision environment, the Atka mackerel fishery in the Aleutian Islands. Consideration sets are modeled using different macro-definitions of spatial regions to focus the micro-level spatial decision making within the fishery and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative macro-level spatial definitions. Results illustrate the biases associated with traditional consideration set assumptions by estimating fishermen's valua-tions for different high-value sites within the Aleutian Islands under alternative consideration set assumptions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how a model that assumes some structure on potential consideration sets reduces the dimensionality problems associated with other endogenous approaches to choice set definition.},

We describe the application of MSE to investigate alternative strategies for achieving EBFM goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance. Although particular to one fishery, the conclusion that an integrated package of measures outperforms single focus measures we argue is likely to apply widely in fisheries that aim to achieve EBFM goals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Fulton et al.},

abstract = {This article reviews legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives during four consecutive Congresses concerning the issues faced by working waterfronts. The objective of this article is to examine two working waterfronts bills, together with relevant testimony before two House subcommittee hearings, and to assess whether the proposed legislation is redundant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) and whether federal-level legislation is appropriate for addressing the identified issues. Contained in three sections the article provides: (1) an assessment of the challenges facing working waterfronts, (2) a description of the federal legislation proposed to address the issues, and (3) an analysis of whether the CZMA already provides the legislative authority to take needed actions. The article concludes with a discussion of how to address working waterfront issues within the context of the federal system of government. Development along the coasts has been a point of interest for residents, regulators, and academics alike. Pressed to accommodate myriad constituencies interested in land along the water's edge, many communities grapple with various economic changes threatening the persistence of their working waterfronts. While largely a local issue, a few states have offered support through funding, ownership covenants, revised taxation strategies, and other tools to help communities and their working waterfronts (Faghin 2014). 1 Moreover, federal legislation targeting the issue was introduced in 2005 during the 109th Congress. Although various working waterfront bills have been proposed over four consecutive Congresses, none have progressed far in the legislative process. Nonetheless, few pieces of legislation have moved forward over these increasingly unproductive sessions. This article's objective is to examine two versions of working waterfronts bills, testimony from two House subcommittee hearings, and assess whether the proposed legislation is redundant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) and whether federal-level legis-lation is appropriate for addressing the issue.

Closures allow biomass to accumulate undisturbed for several years in a row, leading to the harvest of premium-size scallops upon reopening of the fishing grounds.

abstract = {The perception that ecosystem-based fishery management is too complex and poorly defined remains a primary impediment to its broadscale adoption and implementation. Here, I attempt to offer potential solutions to these concerns. Specifically, I focus on pathways that can contribute to overall simplification by moving toward integrated place-based management plans and away from large numbers of species-based plans; by using multispecies or ecosystem models and indicators that permit the simultaneous and consistent assessment of ecosystem components while also incorporating broader environmental factors; and by consolidating individual administrative and regulatory functions now mostly dealt with on a species-by-species basis into a more integrated framework for system-wide decision-making. The approach focuses on emergent properties at the community and ecosystem levels and seeks to identify simpler modeling and analysis tools for evaluation. Adoption of ecosystem-based management procedures relying on simple decision rules and metrics is advocated. It is recommended that we replace static concepts for individual species focusing on maximum sustainable yield with a dynamic ecosystem yield framework that involves setting system-wide reference points along with constraints to protect individual species, habitats, and nontarget organisms in a dynamic environmental setting.},

In addition, the change in the Gini coefficient between these years is decomposed into the changes in the within-source distribution of each income stream and the share of each income stream.

abstract = {Fish stock assessments provide the quantitative scientific information required by resource managers to determine stock status and set annual catch limits to prevent overfishing (Mace et al. 2001). Thus, assessments for managed fish and shellfish stocks represent an important core activity of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Well-established procedures for these assessments have been developed to utilize data from fishery catch monitoring, fishery-independent surveys of abundance, biological studies, and other sources to produce the highly focused deliverables required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA). These data collection and analysis activities constitute a significant portion of the NMFS budget, but resources are insufficient to assess all managed stocks each year (nor is this a realistic target). It is therefore important to provide a transparent, quantitative, and objective process for determining what appropriate assessment targets are, and how to best meet those targets by determining priorities for assessment. This document describes a national framework for prioritization of stock assessments. Although fish stock assessment prioritization will take place under the direction of this national framework, the process will be implemented on a regional1 level coordinating with existing regional processes and planning bodies. The process is not intended to reallocate resources between regions; instead, the focus is on ensuring efficient and transparent decision-making related to stock assessment planning within each region. Prioritization results are considered to be advisory and non-binding, allowing regions to maintain the flexibility to make departures from recommendations when necessary. However, results will have significant visibility and departures should be used judiciously and with adequate justification. Stock assessment prioritization includes first-time assessments for previously unassessed stocks, updating existing assessments using established methods/data, and upgrading assessments to use new types of data/methods. All stocks managed under Federal Fishery Management Plans, as well as additional stocks that may be assessed using NMFS Science Center resources, may be included in assessment prioritization. For stocks that have been previously assessed, the prioritization approach sets targets for assessment completeness (level) and frequency and then determines priorities relative to meeting those targets. For previously unassessed stocks, the system provides an opportunity to periodically examine their fishery importance, ecosystem importance, biological vulnerability to overfishing, preliminary information on fishery impact level (stock status), and data availability to determine which stocks are both sufficiently at risk to warrant an assessment and have sufficient data to conduct at least a data-limited assessment.},

abstract = {Exploring the response of an ecosystem, and subsequent tradeoffs among its biological community, to human perturbations remains a key challenge for the implementation of an ecosystem approaches to fisheries (EAF). To address this and related issues, we developed two network (or energy budget) models, Ecopath and Econetwrk, for the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. These models included 31 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of trophic levels, with the present emphasis to particularly elucidate the role of small pelagics. After initial network balancing, various perturbation scenarios were evaluated to explore how potential changes to different fish, fisheries and lower trophic levels can affect model outputs. Categorically across all scenarios and interpretations thereof, there was minimal change at the second trophic levels and most of the “rebalancing” after a perturbation occurred via alteration of the diet matrix. Yet the model results from perturbations to a balanced energy budget fall into one of three categories. First, some model results were intuitive and in obvious agreement with established ecological and fishing theory. Second, some model results were counter-intuitive upon initial observation, seemingly contradictory to known ecological and fishing theory; but upon further examination the results were explainable given the constraints of an equilibrium energy budget. Finally, some results were counter-intuitive and difficult to reconcile with theory or further examination of equilibrium constraints. A detailed accounting of biomass flows for example scenarios explores some of the non-intuitive results more rigorously. Collectively these results imply a need to carefully track biomass flows and results of any given perturbation and to critically evaluate the conditions under which a new equilibrium is obtained for these types of models, which has implications for dynamic simulations based off of them. Given these caveats, the role of small pelagics as a prominent component of this ecosystem remains a robust conclusion. We discuss how one might use this approach in the context of further developing an EAF, recognizing that a more holistic, integrated perspective will be required as we continue to evaluate tradeoffs among marine biological communities.},

abstract = {A multispecies fishery management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework based on the example of the groundfish fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region of Alaska was used to examine the interplay between a bycatch species and three groundfish species. The study introduces a framework for a realistic multispecies fishery MSE by accounting for fleet dynamics, multispecies fishery quota allocation, and the temporal dynamics of technical interactions. The quota allocation and the fleet dynamics models were implemented using linear programming, and regression approaches were used to make a realistic projection of future users' behavioral response to changes in the fishery. The models were calibrated and then validated using historical and out-of-sample data, respectively. The results highlight the importance of accounting for technical interac-tions and their interannual dynamics for both quota allocation and fleet dynamics to design a realistic multispecies fishery MSE (without them, the amount of lost yield increased). Therefore, particular attention should be paid to understanding human behavior as well as its uncertainty and to refining approaches to incorporate this information into a multispecies fishery management strategy analysis.

abstract = {To understand price changes, one must determine the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price. Conditional on predetermined supply and demand elasticities, we retrieve yearly shifts in regional supply and demand. The relative impact on price from each supply and demand shift is determined through an equilibrium displacement model (EDM). This procedure is applied on a yearly basis for the world salmon market in the period 2002 to 2011. The results indicate a large variation in demand and supply growth both over time and between regions. While average annual price impacts from supply or demand shifts from most regions are not statistically significant, price impacts from supply or demand shifts for specific periods are detected in all but one region. This indicates that the use of smooth trend indicators is likely to be inappropriate for measuring supply and demand shifts and their impacts on price. The procedure presented in this article can be a useful instrument for determining the relative impacts of supply and demand shifts on price in any market with unstable price behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2014, Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether the underlying regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard F- and t-statistics used to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibrium correction mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null hypothesis that there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I0 or I1. Two sets of asymptotic critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I1 and the other if they are all purely I0. These two sets of critical values provide a band covering all possible classifications of the regressors into purely I0, purely I1 or mutually cointegrated. Accordingly, various bounds testing procedures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed tests are consistent, and their asymptotic distribution under the null and suitably defined local alternatives are derived. The empirical relevance of the bounds procedures is demonstrated by a re-examination of the earnings equation included in the UK Treasury macroeconometric model.},

abstract = {In choosing the level of quality to purchase, the buyer of a differentiated product also chooses a point on the marginal price schedule for that product. Hence, in general, the demand functions for product characteristics cannot be consistently estimated by ordinary least squares. Market equilibrium results in a matching of characteristics of demanders and suppliers. This matching restricts the use of buyer and seller characteristics as instruments when estimating demand and supply functions for product characteristics. The paper develops these issues. A stochastic structure for hedonic equilibrium models is then proposed, identification results are presented, and estimation procedures are outlined.

All suggested measures have in common that they are based on the anonymity axiom. Such a perspective may provide a very incomplete picture given that the common objective of most studies investigating the pro-poorness of growth is to test whether specific policy reforms where beneficial to the initially poor or not. I suggest a new concept of pro-poor growth which removes the anonymity axiom, and, using an illustration based on data from Indonesia and Peru, I check whether the assessment of pro-poor growth is different when an anonymous and a non anonymous approach to pro-poor growth is used. I also suggest an original decomposition of poverty changes over time which links both concepts. The results show that the choice of the approach has a drastic impact on the interpretation of the data.},

abstract = {Increasing use of spatial management tools in fisheries requires an understanding of fleet response, and in particular to where displaced fishing effort is likely to move. We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of similar to 4{\%} higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43{\%} greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season.},

abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling predation risk in natural communities is dependent upon knowledge of both the patchiness of predator and prey populations in nature, and on the outcome of behavioral interactions between predator and prey individuals. While both of these areas of predation ecology are rich in theory and data, there are no models that permit these two fundamental components of predation risk to be combined in a quantitative way. Here a model is developed to combine these density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation. The model is used to estimate the contribution of predator and prey population overlap to predation risk, and to quantify both density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation risk for two planktonic invertebrate predators and five rotifer prey. Behavioral data from the literature are used to interpret the prey vulnerability values and demonstrate the utility of the model. The predation risk values obtained for each prey species also are compared to the intrinsic population growth rates (rmax), taken from previous studies. In addition, I test the a priori hypothesis that prey population growth will be negative when predation risk exceeds rmax. The results reveal the presence of severe bottleneck periods where predation risk exceeds the rmax of four of the five prey species, thus supporting the a priori prediction of negative population growth or extremely low prey populations during these periods},

This was the first such management system to be introduced in Australia and among the first worldwide. Its introduction marked a radical departure from traditional management regimes based on limiting the number of boats allowed to operate and other input controls. Because TTQs are a potential management option for many other fisheries, their success or otherwise in improving the economic performance and prospects of the SBT fishery is likely to have ramifications for the future direction of fisheries management in Australia. The impact of the ITQ scheme on fishery profitability is assessed in relation to the expected outcomes of alternative management programs if they had been introduced instead of ITQs. A model that draws together the major biological, physical, and economic relationships in the fishery provides a framework for this analysis.},

paradigms of food web theory. Yet with few exceptions, most food webs and associated metrics are
reported for freshwater or terrestrial systems. I analyzed the food web of the Northeast US Shelf
ecosystem across a large spatial and temporal extent. This speciose food web exhibits a predator:prey
ratio (0.95) and percentage of intermediate species (89{\%}) similar to most other food webs. Other
statistics, such as the percentage of omnivory (62{\%}), percentage of cannibalistic species (31{\%}), number
of cycles (5{\%}), and the total number of links (L; 1562) and species (S; 81) are similar to more
recent and extensively studied food webs. Finally, this food web exhibits a linkage density (L/S; 19.3),
connectivity (C; 48.2{\%}), and Lyapunov stability proxy (S × C; 39.1) that are an order of magnitude
higher than other webs or are disproportionate to the number of species observed in this system.
Although the exact S and C relationship is contentious, the connectivity of food webs with more than
40 species is approximately 10{\%}, which is very different from the near 50{\%} observed for this ecosystem.
The openness of marine ecosystems, lack of specialists, long lifespans, and large size changes
across the life histories of many marine species can collectively make marine food webs more highly
connected than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, contrary to food web theory. Changes in
connectivity also have ramifications for ecosystem functioning and Lyapunov stability. The high connectivity
of this food web and the mathematical determinants for stability are consistent with the
weak nature of species interactions that have been observed and that are required for system persistence.
Yet the historically high exploitation rates of marine organisms obfuscate our understanding of
marine food web stability. It is possible that marine food webs are inherently very different from their
terrestrial or freshwater counterparts, implying the need for modified paradigms of food web theory.},

We investigate vessel and trip characteristics, as well as trip costs and revenues, before and after the implementation of the program. We find an increase in higher value products and associated revenue, as well as consolidation of catch on larger vessels, vessels taking longer trips, and those catching more per trip. Overall, we estimate that the program led to a measureable increase in fishing profits, mainly due to movement toward higher-value products. A back-of-the-envelope calculation results in an implied annual quota rental rate on the order of approximately 15-19{\%}of ex-vessel prices.},

The index-number technique decomposes the contributions of output prices, variable input prices, fixed inputs and productivity to firm profits, adjusted for changes in the natural capital stock. An application of the method is given using micro-level data from a common-pool resource. The indexes provide a ready-made comparison of all firms to the most profitable firm per unit of resource stock. Benchmarking with the decompositions also allows firms and regulators to improve overall industry performance by allowing them to analyze what components are contributing most to (relative) economic profits. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Beyond price and taste, brand names, convenience, and increasingly diet-healthrelated cues are regarded as key attributes in attracting consumer demand. This paper applies a hedonic pricing model to a large panel of consumer packaged food products to estimate monetary value of brand, convenience, and other quality attributes in processed meat and seafood products using 2000–06 Nielsen aggregate weekly scanner data. We find evidence of consumer preferences for perceived “natural” and health attributes over products with higher degrees of processing. The results further indicate that the process of adding value to food products is intricate and dependent on multiple other indicators of product quality, not least health. As such, frozen natural chicken and seafood products may be considered by certain consumers as substitutes for fresh meat and seafood. This finding may carry further implications for the pricing and marketing of lower-value products.},

A system of demand equation models, which take into account the structural breaks, indicated that the spills had a significantly negative impact on the demand for cod. Our results suggest that the amount of radiation detected in cod products negatively affected Japanese demand for cod and positively affected demand for pollock, but did not affect their prices. In addition, we found that consumers' current concerns about,radioactive spills positively affect cod and pollock markets. We concluded that radioactive spills harm the markets, but the impact is negligible.},

abstract = {Profitability change for any firm depends on both price and productivity change. Because most firms have little influence on prices in either output or input markets, oftentimes productivity change is thought to be the most relevant determinant of profitability change. When firms produce a product by harvesting or extracting government-regulated natural resource stocks, it is important for regulators to understand how their decisions influence firm profitability and its underlying drivers. In this study, we use a recently developed index number decomposition method to identify the drivers of profitability, price, and productivity change for vessels operating in the U.S. northeast scallop fishery. Our main finding is that increases in profitability over the period 1996 to 2015 were primarily due to increases in prices for scallops, combined with favorable biomass change. Fishing vessels were able to get higher prices for their harvest because of an innovative spatial harvest strategy, which resulted in catches of large, premium-priced scallops. Remarkably, this system resulted in both an increase in vessels harvesting scallops and large increases in profitability.},

Fisheries management agencies often rely on inputs from user groups in planning, implementation and enforcement of regulatory systems. User involvement in fisheries management is a controversial subject in most of the countries represented here. Too much or too little involvement seem equally problematic. The issue is not so much if and why user groups should be involved, as how, which is basically a political question. User participation is a means through which users are empowered, and there is always a possibility that some will win while others will lose or be left out entirely. However, the question of how user groups should be incorporated in the management process is also a question of institutional design. In this respect, great diversity is demonstrated in our case studies. This suggests that the question of how users should be involved has many possible answers - none of them easy. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

In this paper, we consider market connectedness, assessing volatility spillover between the world's three largest seafood markets, the EU, Japan and the USA, for fish and crustaceans. The data spans from 1990 to 2015, capturing a period of strong growth in the seafood trade, as both the EU and US increased their share of the global seafood trade. We find time-varying and significant spillover between all markets. The results suggest that volatility spillover originates from the net exporting market and is transmitted to the net importing markets, which is particularly evident for crustaceans, where Japan is a positive net transmitter to the EU and US. Further, we can identify several peaks in volatility spillover and relate them to events like El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a and to the financial crisis as a period of high volatility spillover.},

Based on these findings and an unobserved components model for output that decomposes fluctuations into a secular or growth component and a cyclical component we infer that shocks to the former, which we associate with real disturbances, contribute substantially to the variation in observed output. We conclude that macroeconomic models that focus on monetary disturbances as a source of purely transitory fluctuations may never be successful in explaining a large fraction of output variation and that stochastic variation due to real factors is an essential element of any model of macroeconomic fluctuations.},

@article{smith_consumption_2015,
abstract = {The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.},

The advantage of explicitly incorporating predation mortality into age-structured stock assessment models: an application for Atlantic mackerel. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 445–454. An age-structured assessment programme (ASAP) that explicitly incorporates predation mortality was applied to Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Northwest Atlantic. Predatory removals were modelled in the same manner as fishing mortality, with a comparable set of time-series, to produce estimates of predation mortality at age and for each year. Results from the analysis showed that incorporating predation into a mackerel stock assessment model notably altered model outputs. When excluding explicitly modelled rates of predation, the model underestimated the magnitude and uncertainty in spawning-stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment. Further, the rates of predation mortality varied across time and were higher for younger fish. Predation mortality was higher than fishing mortality for fish aged 1 year, approximately equal for 2-year-olds, and lower for older fish (3 years and older). Biological reference points for Atlantic mackerel differed considerably when predation mortality was included. For example, SSBMSY was more than twice as high in the model where predation was incorporated than in the fisheries-only model. Although there are several caveats to the predation model outputs, chief of which is that the estimates are conservative because some mackerel predators were excluded, the results demonstrate the feasibility of executing such an approach with an extant tool. The approach presented here ultimately has the advantage of detecting, and upon detection parsing out, the impact of predators relative to fisheries and has the potential to provide useful information to those interested in small pelagic fish and their associated fisheries.},

Traditionally, PPR is predominantly a social science which has considerable interdisciplinarity, owing to the variety of disciplines which contribute to its delivery and benefit from its outputs. Similarly, the subjects of a marine application of PPR are diverse, and relate to public perceptions of any marine component or activity. Evidence shows this is a growing area of science, and the paper presents a qualitative approach to addressing key questions to inform the continuing development of this field through a workshop held at the Third International Marine Conservation Congress 2014. Key findings are discussed under the themes of 1) the benefits of PPR to marine conservation; 2) priorities for PPR to support marine conservation; 3) making PPR accessible to marine practitioners and policy makers; and 4) interdisciplinary research collaboration to deliver PPR. The workshop supported the development of a framework which illustrates: the key conditions which can support PPR to take place; the types of research which PPR can be used to address; the applications of PPR findings for marine conservation; and the types of marine conservation benefits which can be delivered. As PPR gains an increasing presence in marine conservation, it is hoped that this discussion and framework will support researchers and practitioners to identify opportunities for PPR to deliver benefits, and to work together to achieve these.},

abstract = {Ecological indicators of fishing pressure in space are an important part of the Data Collection Framework (DCF) established by the European Commission in its attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries. These indicators are devised to use the information provided by the Vessel Monitoring System, a mandatory tool for EU fishing vessels which allows to record fishing activity in space and time. This study reports and analyzes trends of DCF fishing pressure indicators in the years 2007-2010 for the Italian trawlers in seven Mediterranean geographic sub-areas and the related trends of landing per unit effort. In addition, new versions of these indicators are developed and their performances compared to the DCF ones by a simulation approach. The rationale for these new version of indicators is based on: (i) the development of a formal definition of "fishing ground", allowing for innovative statistical analyses of fishing patterns in space and time; (ii) the revision of issues affecting DCF indicators. Results provide: (i) the first extensive documentation of space use by fisheries through time; (ii) evidences of subtle yet significant changes in fishing pattern which, in agreement to other studies, indirectly support a decline of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean; (iii) improved versions of DCF fishing pressure indicators, obtained via the identification and analysis of fishing grounds and the assessment of aggregation by Gini's G index. The latter point could mark an important progress in order to overcome some critical weakness evidenced by DCF indicators. Moreover, the statistical identification and analysis of fishing grounds could represent a valuable insight in quantitative investigations of fisheries impacts and effects, even beyond indicators computation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Are natural resources a "curse" or a "blessing"? The empirical evidence suggests tha either outcome is possible. This paper surveys a variety of hypotheses and supportin evidence for why some countries benefit and others lose from the presence of natu ral resources. These include that a resource bonanza induces appreciation of the real exchange rate, deindustrialization, and bad growth prospects, and that these adverse effects are more severe in volatile countries with bad institutions and lack of rule of law, corruption, presidential democracies, and underdeveloped financial systems. Another hypothesis is that a resource boom reinforces rent grabbing and civil con flict especially if institutions are bad, induces corruption especially in nondemocrati countries, and keeps in place bad policies. Finally, resource rich developing economies seem unable to successfully convert their depleting exhaustible resources into other productive assets. The survey also offers some welfare-based fiscal rules for harness ing resource windfalls in developed and developing economies. (JEL 047, Q32, Q33},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014. All rights reserved.Fisheries management is commonly based on the outputs of single-species stock assessment models. While such models are appropriate for tactical issues such as quota setting, they typically omit explicit trophic interactions between different parts of the ecosystem. To successfully manage multiple fisheries in the same ecosystem, we need to understand how fishing one species may indirectly affect other species. In this paper, we used a simulation model of the southern Benguela ecosystem, built in the Atlantis framework, to explore fisheries interaction effects. We first measured the impact of fishing different stocks individually at FMSY, the hypothetical level of fishing effort which produces maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in a single-species modelling context. We then applied FMSY to all stocks simultaneously and compared the simultaneous yield with the sum of yields from the individual applications of FMSY. Contrary to expectations, the total catch was higher under the simultaneous scenario. We explored our results by studying the influences of trophic interaction between species at different levels of the foodweb, and found that our overall result was driven by two key factors: volumetric dominance of small pelagic fish in the total catch, and asymmetric influences of competition and predation between piscivorous and planktivorous species. The simultaneous increase in fishing pressure across multiple species in the model led to increased effective carrying capacity for small pelagic species (due to reduced competition), but reduced carrying capacity for piscivorous species (due to reduced small pelagic prey). This work has important implications for the design of tactical multispecies models for use in ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

abstract = {Descriptions and analyses of citizens' or households' income have a long tradition in economics. A large body of research has recognized that levels of income and how income is distributed are important contributors to the wealth of nations. Within the broader context of income and its distribution, there has also been a considerable amount of research on the process underlying income distribution that is, income mobility. The relevance of income mobility is manifold. First of all, mobility is an indicator for an open society providing economic opportunities for everyone. As people are normally risk averse, they are interested in a steady income stream. This can be called the security aspect. Another facet of income mobility is the incentive aspect. Upward mobility provides incentives for successful economic activity as it is possible to move up the income ladder. If upward mobility offers the “carrot”, downward mobility epitomizes the “stick” of economic activity. Downward mobility increases insecurity and insecurity is harmful to well-being. We use data covering the whole working lives of workers/employees to shed light on income mobility. This will result in more information about the adequacy of some assumptions of the life-cycle theory concerning the development of income over time – and especially on the inverse U-shape assumption of income profiles.},

abstract = {Commercial fishery participants in Alaska are increasing in age, and the next generation of fishermen faces numerous, complex barriers to entry into the industry. Although these barriers are now widely recognized, what remains to be seen is whether or not the youngest generation of coastal residents will choose place-based fishing livelihoods. In this study, we surveyed seventh through 12th grade students in the fishery-dependent Bristol Bay and Kodiak Archipelago regions of Alaska to explore what factors best predict students' attitudes about commercial fishing and their communities. We used multinomial logit models of Likert-scale responses predicted by geographic, demographic, and social variables, as well as conditional inference trees to understand the direction, magnitude, and importance of the relationships among the predictor and response variables. Positive attitudes about fishing were best predicted by student experience in the commercial fishing industry, whether the student wanted to be involved in fishing in the future, and the importance of subsistence fishing to the student's family. Age, how the student felt about their life, the importance of subsistence activities, and whether the student grew up in the community in which they were surveyed were all strongly related to the student's positive attitude about their community. Youth surveyed in this study were highly uncertain about their futures, but key periods of exposure through community and family ties to fishing emerged as important mechanisms for engagement among the next generation of potential fishermen.},

A more detailed data set is used for the period 2001???2014 which allows for a more thorough investigation of consolidation in both fleet segments using Herfindahl-Hirchman Indexes, Gini coefficients and Lorenz-curves. The biggest firms in the two fleet segments increased their share of quotas throughout the period but the quota market is though still quite competitive. The distribution of quotas between firms has become more unequal, and there is also clear evidence of increasing transfers between harbours, especially in the case of the quota shares of hook-and-line boats. However, the results also indicate that spatial concentration has been much less than consolidation at firm level during the period under consideration. This would indicate that firms have mostly grown in size by merging with local firms or buying out smaller local operators.},

This paper examines changes following the implementation of a catch share system in the Peruvian anchovy fishery, which is the world's largest commercial fishery by volume. After implementation of the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) management system, there was a shift toward higher value product and a 105{\%} increase in per-unit revenue with the IVQ program. Additionally, landings are more spread out over the fishing season with an increase in the number of fishing days and fleet consolidation occurs over time with a shift toward larger vessels in the steel fleet. Finally, using cost estimates from a large fishing firm on the cost of steel vessel operation, variable harvesting profit is estimated to have increased from 34{\%} to 41{\%} of the ex-vessel revenue pre-IVQ to 63–65{\%} post.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. We exploit the structure of the Clean Air Act to provide new evidence on the capitalization of total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pol-lution into housing values. This legislation imposes strict regulations on polluters in " nonattainment " counties, which are defined by con-centrations of TSPs that exceed a federally set ceiling. TSPs nonat-tainment status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution and increases in county-level housing prices. When nonattainment status is used as an instrumental variable for TSPs, we find that the elasticity of housing values with respect to particulates concentrations ranges from Ϫ0.20 to Ϫ0.35. These estimates of the average marginal willingness to pay for clean air are robust to quasi-experimental re-gression discontinuity and matching specification tests. Further, they are far less sensitive to model specification than cross-sectional and fixed-effects estimates, which occasionally have the " perverse " sign. We also find modest evidence that the marginal benefit of reductions of TSPs is lower in communities with relatively high pollution levels, This content downloaded from 155.206.138.89 on Thu, 10 Aug 2017 14:31:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms does air quality matter? 377 which is consistent with preference-based sorting.

abstract = {While historians of economics have noted the transition toward empirical work in economics since the 1970s, less understood is the shift toward " quasi-experimental " methods in applied microeconomics. Angrist and Pischke (2010) trumpet the wide application of these methods as a " credibility revolution " in econometrics that has finally provided persuasive answers to a diverse set of questions. Particularly influential in the applied areas of labor, education, public, and health economics, the methods shape the knowledge produced by economists and the expertise they possess. First documenting their growth bibliometrically, this paper aims to illuminate the origins, content, and contexts of quasi-experimental research designs, which seek natural experiments to justify causal inference. To highlight lines of continuity and discontinuity in the transition, the quasi-experimental program is situated in the historical context of the Cowles econometric framework and a case study from the economics of education is used to contrast the practical implementation of the approaches. Finally, significant historical contexts of the paradigm shift are explored, including the marketability of quasi-experimental methods and the 1980s crisis in econometrics.},

For this study, the model integrates several institutional arrangements related to catch share management. The current French co-management system with non-transferability of quota is compared to an alternative ITQ system in a context of transition to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Trade-offs between ecological and socio-economic impacts are highlighted and the effectiveness of governance scenarios is discussed in regard to the challenge of capacity adjustment. Results emphasize that the introduction of ITQ is expected to reduce by 40{\%} the number of vessels in the fishery. While effectively mitigating the economic impacts of the transition phase to MSY, ITQs are also expected to significantly increase the fishing effort by trawlers, which may cause ecological concerns.

We study a longitudinal sample of over one million French workers from more than five hundred thousand employing firms. We decompose real total annual compensation per worker into components related to observable employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity, and residual variation. Except for the residual, all components may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects explain about 90{\%} of inter-industry wage differentials and about 75{\%} of the firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively little of either differential.},

The open access induced problems can be corrected by an individual transferable quota system only if both the target species and the bycatch species have tradable quotas, and only if the bycatch species does not have existence value. There exists a range of the bycatch-to-target species harvest levels for which the total harvest of each will be exactly taken by a given technology, even under open access. However, there may not even exist a unique open access equilibrium if bycatch is allocated by ''rule of capture.'' Prohibitions on the sale of bycatch reduce the bycatch level, but they also reduce social welfare.},

The great value of the Apple II + was that we could take the computer programs we had been building on mainframe and mini-computers, and make them available to the many fisheries biologists who also had Apple II + 's. About 6 months after we got our first Apple, John Glaister came through Vancouver and saw what we were doing and realized that his agency (New South Wales State Fisheries) had the same equipment and could run the same programs. John organized a training course in Australia where we showed about 25 Australian fisheries biologists how to use microcomputers to do many standard fisheries analyses. In the process of organizing this and sub sequent courses we developed a series of lecture notes. Over the last 10 years these notes have evolved into the chapters of this book.},

abstract = {The report is based on a literature review, interviews conducted during visits to each study community, analysis of federal and state and local fisheries data and community data, and a household survey conducted by the City of King Cove. The primary focus of the study is on King Cove, because it is a larger community which has experienced greater effects of crab rationalization. Crab rationalization resulted in dramatic consolidation in Bering Sea crab fisheries. During the first two years of rationalization, consolidation reduced the number of boats participating in the Bristol Bay Red King Crab fishery and the Bering Sea Snow Crab fishery by about two-thirds. This consolidation in the fleet, and the corresponding reduction in crab fishing jobs and crab boat spending, was a major immediate short-term factor driving economic impacts on the three study communities to date. Longer-term concerns of community residents extend beyond these immediate economic impacts to many other issues.},

Settlement houses and fishing routines were observed from 1986 to 1998. Interviews of the settler/owners of the five largest settlement houses in New Bedford and early settlers and fishermen from the 1930s and 1940s were conducted. Financial settlers helped bring order and increased trust to financial settlements that, prior to the 1930s, had largely been conducted in cash and based on unwritten agreements. Most contemporary and many of the earliest settlers are female and women's contributions to the fishing industry are discussed. Emphasis is also placed on the fisher-based solution that settlement houses represent; implications for use in co-management strategies and the need to reduce the adversarial atmosphere in fisheries governance are discussed.},

abstract = {The impacts of climate change on fish and fisheries is expected to increase the demand for more accurate stock projections and harvest strategies that are robust to shifting production regimes. To address these concerns, we evaluate the performance of fishery management control rules for eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock stock under climate change. We compared the status quo policy with six alternative management strategies under two types of recruitment pattern simulations: one that follows temperature-induced trends and the other that follows a stationary recruitment pattern similar to historical observations. A subset of 82 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models provided temperature inputs from which an additional 100 stochastic simulated recruitments were generated to obtain the same overall recruitment variability as observed for the stationary recruitment simulations. Results indicate that status quo management with static reference points and current ecosystem considerations will result in much lower average catches and an increased likelihood of fishery closures, should reduced recruitment because of warming conditions hold. Alternative reference point calculations and control rules have similar performance under stationary recruitment relative to status quo, but may offer significant gains under the changing environmental conditions.},

Estimating von Bertalanffy growth parameters from growth increment data using a linear mixed-effects model, with an application to the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 2165 – 2175. We introduce a novel linear mixed-effects method for estimating von Bertalanffy growth parameters from growth increment data that lack explicit age information. The method is simple to implement and can incorporate and estimate variability in both the asymptotic size L 1 and the Brody growth coefficient K. Simulations indicate that estimates from the method are accurate over a range of conditions. The method is applied to growth data from more than 6000 Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) shells from the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank. Sea scallops grow to a larger asymptotic shell height on Georges Bank than on the Mid-Atlantic Bight and in areas closed to fishing on Georges Bank than on the fished portions. Depth and latitude had significant effects on scallop growth in both the Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank, with smaller asymptotic shell heights in deeper water and at higher latitudes.},

abstract = {Scale economies and agglomeration externalities are alleged to be important determinants of economic growth. To assess these effects, we outline and estimate a microfoundations model based on a dynamic cost function specification. This model provides for the separate identification of the impacts of extemalities and cyclical utilization on short-and long-run scale economies and input substitution pattems. We find that scale economies are prevalent in U.S. manufacturing, cost savings and scale effects often attributed to intemal inputs may be due to extemal factors, and supply-side agglomeration effects are greater than demand-side, especially in the long run. (JEL O47, E23) The importance of agglomeration extemal-ities for explaining cyclical fluctuations and growth has been examined in various fields in economics, including the literature on techni-cal change and productivity growth; business cycles; regional economic growth and location theory; and endogenous economic growth. Agglomeration or thick market effects are of-ten assumed to operate through knowledge spillovers that may result from activity levels of suppliers, customers, and other firms in an industry. These extemalities appear as scale economies, which must be identified sepa-rately from fluctuations arising from intemal factors such as short-run fixities (cyclical uti-lization) and long-run retums to scale, in order to evaluate the determinants of growth. Robert E. Hall (1990) identified scale ef-fects arising from thick markets as a potential cause for invariance of the Solow residual. Following this lead, Ricardo J. Caballero and Richard K. Lyons (henceforth, CL) (1992) and Eric J. Baitlesman et al. (henceforth, BCL) (1994) pursued the issue of agglomeration ef-fects in more detail, distinguishing between short-and long-run extemalities. Agglomeration},

abstract = {Fish live in communities, and most fisheries catch multiple species, yet fishery management predominately focuses on single species. In many multispecies fisheries, a variety of species are generally caught together at similar rates. Failure to account for this adequately in management has resulted in serial depletion and alterations to the ecosystem. Ideally, multispecies fisheries management should strive to produce good yields from specific valuable stocks and avoid adverse impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems. Moreover, multispecies management should aim to build resilience to changes in stock productivity and distribution driven by climate change. Here, we present tools and pathways that seven fisheries are adopting to achieve these goals. These case studies – from Mexico, Cuba, and Chile – differ in data richness, governance structure, and management resources. The management systems are also in various stages of evolution from unmanaged to complete management of a single species but transitioning to multispecies management. While various analytical tools and decision-making processes are described in the case studies, a common feature is the use of participatory stakeholder processes to build capacity and socialize the importance of multispecies management. We use lessons from these cases to recommend a multispecies management approach to overcome the limitations of current practices (typically single-species catch limits or large spatial restrictions), using the participatory processes and data-limited assessments to create stock complexes that simplify multispecies management (i.e., the “fish baskets” approach). Indicator species for each fish basket are identified to support the development of fishery performance indicators, reference values, harvest control rules, and management measures to create an adaptive management cycle to enhance the fishery's resilience to impacts induced by climate change and other factors.},

The evaluation was implemented in the R programming system, using FLR libraries, and was based on stochastic simulations of the complete fishery system (including a biological operating model, a knowledge production model with "live" stock assessments, and a simple implementation model). The generation of appropriate time-series of recruitment was of key importance for a stock like North Sea haddock which produces sporadic large year-classes. Although some refinement of growth and discard models is still required, tentative conclusions can be reached on the likely efficacy of different management plans.

abstract = {When there exist omitted effects, measurement error, and/or simultaneity in multilevel models, explanatory variables may be correlated with random components, and standard estimation methods do not provide consistent estimates of model parameters. This paper introduces estimators that are consistent under such conditions. By employing generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation techniques in multilevel modeling, the authors present a series of estimators along a robust to efficient continuum. This continuum depends on the assumptions that the analyst makes regarding the extent of the correlated effects. It is shown that the GMM approach provides an overarching framework that encompasses well-known estimators such as fixed and random effects estimators and also provides more options. These GMM estimators can be expressed as instrumental variable (IV) estimators which enhances their interpretability. Moreover, by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the data, the current technique does not require additional variables unlike traditional IV methods. Further, statistical tests are developed to compare the different estimators. A simulation study examines the finite sample properties of the estimators and tests and confirms the theoretical order of the estimators with respect to their robustness and efficiency. It further shows that not only are regression coefficients biased, but variance components may be severely underestimated in the presence of correlated effects. Empirical standard errors are employed as they are less sensitive to correlated effects when compared to model-based standard errors. An example using student achievement data shows that GMM estimators can be effectively used in a search for the most efficient among unbiased estimators.},

abstract = {The Gulf of Maine, NW Atlantic Ocean, is a productive, seasonal foraging ground for Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ), but commercial landings of adult size classes were up to 40{\%} below the allocated total allowable catch between 2004 to 2008 for the rod and reel, harpoon, and purse seine categories in the Gulf of Maine. Reduction in Atlantic bluefin tuna catches in the Gulf of Maine could represent a decline in spawning stock biomass, but given wide-ranging, complex migration patterns, and high energetic requirements, an alternative hypothesis is that their dispersal patterns shifted to regions with higher prey abundance or profitability, reducing availability to U.S. fishing fleets. This study fit generalized linear models to Atlantic bluefin tuna landings data collected from fishermen's logbooks (1979-2005) as well as the distances between bluefin tuna schools and Atlantic herring ( Clupea harengus ), a primary prey species, to test alternative hypotheses for observed shifts in Atlantic bluefin tuna availability in the Gulf of Maine. For the bluefin model, landings varied by day of year, latitude and longitude. The effect of latitude differed by day of year and the effect of longitude differed by year. The distances between Atlantic bluefin tuna schools and Atlantic herring schools were significantly smaller (p{\textless}0.05) than would be expected from a randomly distributed population. A time series of average bluefin tuna school positions was positively correlated with the average number of herring captured per tow on Georges Bank in spring and autumn surveys respectively (p{\textless}0.01, r 2 =0.24, p{\textless}0.01, r 2 =0.42). Fishermen's logbooks contributed novel spatial and temporal information towards testing these hypotheses for the bluefin tuna fishery.},

abstract = {Is there a way to understand why some global environmental externalities are addressed effectively, whereas others are not? The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments, and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, execute the Montreal Protocol to manage emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions.

abstract = {Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance. Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible. We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather. After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fisherman's probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82{\%} compared with only 31{\%} in the former race to fish fishery. Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79{\%}. These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries. catch shares | occupational safety | rights-based fisheries management | risk | sustainable fisheries},

Using this method we examine (i) cross national differences in average insecurity levels, (ii) the effects of taxes and transfers, and (iii) relationships between the insecurity index and household income. Insecurity estimates based on pre‐government incomes are highest in Britain and lowest in Germany, however results for post‐government incomes are highest in the U.S. It is also shown that insecurity estimates based upon pre‐government incomes are heavily concentrated at the lower end of the distribution; although governments are effective at smoothing the income streams of these households. We also search for determinants of our measure and find that gender, household size, health status, and industry affiliations of the household head are the most significant covariates.},

However, empirical studies face two challenges: heterogeneous behavioral responses and unobservable resource abundance. This paper addresses these two problems simultaneously by using an unusual data set and an esti- mation technique developed in the industrial organization literature.We apply the methods to location and species choices in the Gulf ofMexico reef-fish fishery. The models are used to explore spatial effort substitution in response to two marine reserves. Individual attributes from a survey of vessel captains are linked to each fisherman's observed daily trip informa- tion to control for observable heterogeneity. Some unobservable abundance information is captured by location- and species-specific constants and estimated by contraction mapping. The empirical results confirm that there is significant heterogeneity in fishermen's response to the formation of marine reserves. They also show that ignoring unobservable abundance information will lead to significant bias in predicting spatial fishing effort.},

In the northeastern United States, commercial fishing operating cost models may suffer from selection bias, as they are often estimated using data collected for biological, rather than economic, purposes. We investigate the effects of sampling bias on trip cost model estimations using weighted/unweighted least squares and Heckman sample selection models. Results suggest that (1) the propensity for a trip to carry an observer is not random with respect to costs and that (2) selection bias exists in the majority of cost models investigated. To gauge the magnitude of selection bias, we compare results of the unweighted least squares and Heckman models. The differences between models can lead to erroneous conclusions at the subfleet level and in estimating trip cost maxima. Results suggest that assessing and correcting for selection bias is necessary when using sampled fishing cost data.},

Unfortunately, their formulation does not lead to a "natural" interpretation of the generalized least squares estimates, or of the relationships of these estimates to other estimates in the same way diagonalization of the variance-covariance matrix by means of an appropriate orthogonal transformation does. The charac-teristic roots of the variance-covariance matrix for the disturbances in a three component model which has been studied by Wallace and Hussain are derived here. It is shown how knowledge of these roots and the characteristic vectors associated with them leads to a form of the inverse matrix which may be more readily interpreted, as well as a number of other useful results, including an interpretation of the poor small sample properties of estimates which incorporate dummy variables for each individual.},

abstract = {Among species interactions, competition is obviously more nuanced to investigate than predation. Certainly there have been copious, seminal works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

In this study fishers' income levels are investigated in four Nordic countries; Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden for different types of fishers and vessels and in comparison to alternative occupations. The most important result is that fishers in these countries are doing relatively well, and only in Sweden is the fishers' average income level below the average national income. Within the fleets, there are substantial differences. Owners of coastal vessels tend to have the lowest income, and also lower than crews. Owners as well as crews on larger vessels tend to do much better and in the largest fishing nations, Iceland and Norway, they do especially well.},

abstract = {In this article we provide a comparison of different formulations for hedonic regression analysis in order to construct a quality adjusted price index for the Spanish car market over the period 1981 to 2005. Specifically, we address the issue of instability of coefficients over time, and propose two alternative estimation procedures based, firstly, on a moving sample of observations and, secondly, on a moving average of estimated coefficients in single period equations. The statistical tests applied support the proposed methodologies. On empirical grounds two conclusions can be emphasized. Firstly, our study concludes that, taking quality changes into account, car prices in Spain deflated by consumer price index (CPI) declined by 40{\%} between 1981 and 2005. This result is robust to the alternative estimation procedures employed in the study. Secondly, an analysis of $\sigma$-convergence shows that for quality adjusted prices a clear trend in $\sigma$-convergence emerges between 1986 and 1992, whereas such a trend does not exists for observed prices. This result has to be related to Spain's integration into the European Community (EC). {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Fulton2011a,
abstract = {There is broad consensus that the main problem facing fisheries globally is too many boats chasing too few fish. Unfortunately it is also possible to argue that there are too many proposed solutions and not enough practical answers to improving fisheries management. There is a deepening divide between those who propose alternative regulatory controls on fishers, including establishing large areas permanently closed to fishing, and those who argue for better alignment of incentives combined with broad participation of resource users in fishery management decisions (in simple terms, between top down and bottom up systems of governance). However despite the choice of policy instruments used, a consistent outcome is that resource users behave in a manner that is often unintended by the designers of the management system. Hence whilst uncertainty is broadly recognized as a pervasive feature of fisheries management, to date most of the attention has focussed on only part of that uncertainty – scientific uncertainty about the status of exploited resources. The effect of uncertainty generated on the human side of fisheries science and management has received much less attention. However, the uncertainty generated by unexpected resource user behaviour is critical as it has unplanned consequences and leads to unintended management outcomes. Using empirical evidence of unexpected resource user behaviour and reviewing current responses to unexpected management outcomes, we identify different approaches that both improve prediction of human behaviour in fisheries systems and identify management measures that are more robust to these sources of uncertainty. However, unless the micro scale drivers of human behaviour that contribute to macro scale implementation uncertainty are communicated effectively to managers and considered more regularly and in greater depth, unanticipated responses to management actions will continue to undermine management systems and threaten the sustainability of fisheries.},

Evidence of absolute convergence in farm incomes is explained by short-run adjustments towards equilibrium or target incomes conditional upon prices, technology and farm business size, with farm business growth conditional upon survival found to have had no significant redistributive effect.},

abstract = {Conventional sectoral management and piecemeal governance are considered less and less appropriate in pursuit of sustainable development. Ecosystem based marine spatial management (EB-MSM) is an approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including human uses, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. Marine spatial planning and ocean zoning are emerging concepts that can support EB-MSM. EB-MSM is driven by high-level goals that managers aim to achieve through the implementation of measures. High-level goals and objectives need to be translated into more operational objectives before specific targets, limits and measures can be elaborated.Monitoring, evaluation and adaptation are necessary to ensure that marine management measures are both effective and efficient. Solid monitoring frameworks are the foundation of adaptive management, as they provide the necessary information to evaluate performance and the effectiveness of management actions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) - possibly set up in networks - constitute a key component in EB-MSM policies and practises and have been applied as a cornerstone in conservation of marine biodiversity, management of fish populations, development of coastal tourism, etc. Moreover, MPA experiences have provided methods and concepts (such as zoning) to a wider EB-MSM context. The assignment of values to biophysical features of the marine environment allows the direct assessment of related management choices and may assist EB-MSM.A range of monetary valuation techniques have been proposed to reduce attributes of goods and services to a single metric. However, in the marine environment such an approach is often over simplistic, and thus less reductive techniques may be necessary. Rather than producing a single metric, the results of non-monetary assessments guide policy allowing weight to be given as necessary to potential areas of conflict and consensus.Strategies to take into account climate change effects and geohazard risks in EB-MSM have been applied or proposed worldwide. EB-MSM regimes must be alert to such risks and flexible to account for changes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {As US beef and pork prices approached record high levels in 2014, indus-try analysts expressed surprised at consumer response. Because the relative price swings have occurred only recently, traditional approaches to demand analysis that rely on historical data series may be less useful than is typically the case. Employing one of the largest and longest-running choice experiments, we analyze data on 110,295 choices made by 12,255 consumers observed over a year-long time period co-inciding with historically high meat prices. Our findings reveal nonlinear demands for meat products, with demand being more inelastic at higher prices. Ground beef, steak, and pork chop demands are more sensitive to changes in chicken breast price than the reverse. Moreover, cross-price elasticities between disaggregate meat pro-ducts shrink as prices rise. Consumers' incomes significantly affect demand inter-relationships. Higher income consumers are more likely to choose steak and chicken breasts and are less likely to choose ground beef, chicken wings, and deli ham than are lower income consumers. High-income consumers tend to be less responsive to own-price changes and more responsive to cross-price changes than lower income consu-mers. This analysis provides estimates of structural demand parameters that help explain current meat expenditure patterns, and the results have implications for the assumption of linearity often invoked in policy analyses.},

abstract = {While the historical character of US fisheries has been dominated by the idea of open access, the last several decades have seen sometimes quite radical changes to this basic way of thinking. Government regulation has increasingly taken the form of limited access to fisheries by various means. The Atlantic Sea Scallop fishery in the Northeast US provides a unique insight into the meanings, practices, and implications of these changes in the character of property relations. While the fishery has seen rebounding success in the past few years, the scallop fishery also encapsulates a number of the changes and controversies confronting fisheries worldwide. At the same time, the regulatory regime has seen a shift towards area-based management, which underscores spatial heterogeneity of the resources while using a culturally constructed view of fishermen. New area-based management measures have forced into view a fundamental difference in access between a more property-oriented industrial style of fishing and an open access fishery. These differences are found in and through New Bedford, the largest scalloping port in the Northeast, opening up the notion of a fishing community to multiple interests, positions, and interpretations, with implications for understandings of management, community, and the social practices of fishing.},

abstract = {Interactions between fisheries and aquaculture have become a major issue that is still insufficiently studied. Therefore, the objective of this article is to test whether the cultured and wild gilthead sea bream in the Spanish seafood markets are integrated. By using the Johansen methodology, cointegration of the price series of farmed and wild gilthead sea bream was tested. In contrast to previous studies, our econometric results show that wild and the farmed gilthead sea bream form two heterogeneous products in the Spanish market. These new results question the generalization currently accepted by the scientific literature that farmed and wild fish are substitutes when they belong to the same species. The binomial product-market, along with some specific features of the Spanish market, such as the negative perceptions of aquaculture by some significant groups of consumers, appeared to have a great explanatory power for justifying these different results.},

We introduce an analytical model with firm heterogeneity to distinguish between traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners, and inframarginal rent, which accrues to those with high skill. We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry. In our application to an important US fishery, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource, but without substantial free grandfathering, the top harvesters would rationally oppose the transition to property rights.},

Estimating marginal returns to policies is a central task of economic cost-benefit analysis. A comparison between marginal benefits and marginal costs determines the optimal size of a social program. For example, to evaluate the optimality of a policy that promotes expansion in college attendance, analysts need to estimate the return to college for the marginal student and compare it to the marginal cost of the policy. This is a relatively simple task (i) if the effect of the policy is the same for every one (conditional on observed variables) or (ii) if the effect of the policy varies across individuals given observed variables but agents either do not know their idiosyn cratic returns to the policy, or if they know them, they do not act on them. In these cases, individuals do not choose their schooling based on their realized idiosyncratic individual returns, and thus the marginal and average ex post returns to schooling are the same.1 Under these conditions, the mean marginal return to college can be estimated using conventional methods applied to the following Mincer equation: (1) Y = a + 0S + e, where Y is the log wage, S is a dummy va the return to schooling (which may vary standard problem of selection bias (S corr problem can be solved by a variety of conv (IV), regression discontinuity, and selectio},

abstract = {The Northeast US Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME) has experienced 2 major pressures: fishing and climate. The magnitude and rate of response to these pressures are species-specific and depend on each individual species' behavior, physiology and life histories. Thus, species assemblages can be expected to change as a result of the sum of each individual species' response. In previous studies, distinct species assemblages have been identified in each of the 4 subregions by which the NES LME has traditionally been assessed: Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), Southern New England (SNE), Georges Bank (GB), and Gulf of Maine (GOM). In this study, we confirm that each subregion has a distinct species assemblage, but found that those assemblages are shifting over time. The shift appears to be towards species that prefer warmer water. The result is a species assemblage within each subregion that more closely resembles the historic assemblage found in the adjacent subregion to the south. These shifts have occurred in response to a combination of both fishing and climate, and are highly nonlinear. Therefore, current reductions in fishing pressure may not be adequate to return the system to a more historic species assemblage.},

We used an ensemble of size-based multispecies models to investigate the effects of different rates of fishing mortality (F) and fleet configurations on yield, biomass, risk of collapse and community structure. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and FMSY for 21 modelled species' populations in the North Sea were defined at the Nash equilibrium, where any independent change in F for any species would not increase that species' MSY. Fishing mortality ranges leading to “Pretty Good Yield” (F-PGY), by species, were defined as ranges yielding 0.95 MSY. Weight and value of yield from the entire fishery increased marginally when all species were fished at the upper end of F-PGY ranges rather than at FMSY, but risk of species' collapse and missing community targets also increased substantially. All risks fell markedly when fishing at the lower end of F-PGY ranges, but with small impacts on total fishery yield or value. While fishing anywhere within F-PGY ranges gives managers flexibility to manage trade-offs in multispecies mixed fisheries, our results suggest high long-term yields and disproportionately lower risks of stock collapse are achieved when F FMSY for all component stocks.},

This is done using a non-linear Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System coupled with seasonal patterns and controlling for endogeneity. The model used here is able to address seasonality in demand in terms of varying flexibilities over seasons and deals with endogeneity in accordance with biological stock assessment data. Empirical results show significant season-varying market behaviors and the presence of endogeneity in the demand system. All market categories are price inflexible across seasons.

The decision maker in our model simultaneously evaluates optimal investment in monitoring and population control. Using a recently-devised method for solving continuous-state Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), we find that the ability to learn through monitoring can alter the role of population control in the optimal policy function, for example by reducing control intensity in favor of monitoring. Optimal monitoring depends on the management context, including in our application lionfish population structure.

More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels ( {\textgreater} 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects. The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.},

abstract = {Biomass and commercial catch rates of Atlantic sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus in the USA generally declined from the 1960s through the mid-1990s as fishing mortality increased. Sporadic large recruitment events temporarily increased landings but also encouraged higher overall fishing effort and thereby contributed to the long-term declines in resource abundance. In 1994, a number of new management measures were introduced, including a moratorium on new permits, limitations on days at sea, gear and crew restrictions, and year-round closed areas. During 1994-2005, the biomass of sea scallops in the U.S. sector of Georges Bank increased by a factor of about 18, while the biomass of sea scallops in the Middle Atlantic Bight increased by about eight times. These increases were primarily due to the area closures. Biomass in the Georges Bank closed areas was 25 times higher in 2005 than in 1994, and the 2005 level constituted over 80{\%} of the biomass in the U.S. portion of Georges Bank. Substantial increases in sea scallop abundance and biomass also occurred in two of the three areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight that were closed rotationally to sea scallop fishing for 3 years. Mean recruitment on Georges Bank did not significantly increase since the closures there, but very strong recruitment has been observed downstream of one of the mid-Atlantic rotational closures. In the open areas, responses to effort reduction measures were minimal until 1999, but biomass, commercial catch rates, and landings substantially increased during 1999-2005 due to effort controls and increased recruitment in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The recovery of U.S. sea scallop populations demonstrates that the combination of effort controls and area management can rapidly rebuild severely depleted fisheries.},

abstract = {Households " sort " across neighborhoods according to their wealth and their preferences for public goods, social characteristics, and commuting opportunities. The aggregation of these individual choices in markets and in other institutions influences the supply of amenities and local public goods. Pollution, congestion, and the quality of public education are examples. Over the past decade, advances in economic models of this sorting process have led to new framework that promises to alter the ways we conceptualize the policy evaluation process in the future. These " equilibrium sorting " models use the properties of market equilibria, together with information on household behavior, to infer structural parameters that characterize preference heterogeneity. The results can be used to develop theoretically consistent predictions for the welfare implications of future policy changes. Analysis is not confined to marginal effects or a partial equilibrium setting. Nor is it limited to prices and quantities. Sorting models can integrate descriptions of how non-market goods are generated, estimate how they affect decision making and, in turn, predict how they will be affected by future policies targeting prices or quantities. Conversely, sorting models can predict how equilibrium prices and quantities will be affected by policies which target product quality, information, or amenities generated by the sorting process. These capabilities are just beginning to be understood and used in applied research. This survey article aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on equilibrium sorting, the new possibilities for policy analysis, and the conceptual and empirical challenges that define the frontiers of the literature.},

The optimal utilization of quotas is thus dependent on development of an efficient quota market, but markets in multispecies IFQ fisheries develop slowly and may fail to perform efficiently even after several years. In 2011 an IFQ system was implemented for the Pacific groundfish trawl fishery in the US. After four years, the quota market does not appear to be yielding effi-cient prices for many species or distributing quota efficiently. I explore the structure and performance of the QP market and discuss the impediments to market efficiency. Drawing from theory and experience in other multi-species IFQ systems, I discuss other quota distribution and catch-balancing mechanisms that can supplement and perhaps improve inefficient markets and enable higher quota utilization rates.},

abstract = {Forecasts of the future abundance of western Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ) have, for nearly two decades, been based on two competing views of future recruitment potential: (1) a “low” recruitment scenario based on hockey-stick (two-line) curve where the expected level of recruitment is set equal to the geometric mean of the recruitment estimates for the years after a supposed regime-shift in 1975, and (2) a “high” recruitment scenario based on a Beverton-Holt curve fit to the time series of spawner-recruit pairs beginning in 1970. Several investigators inferred the relative plausibility of these two scenarios based on measures of their ability to fit estimates of spawning biomass and recruitment derived from stock assessment outputs. Typically, these comparisons have assumed the assessment estimates of spawning biomass are known without error. It is shown here that ignoring error in the spawning biomass estimates can predispose model-choice approaches to favor the regime-shift hypothesis over the Beverton-Holt curve with higher recruitment potential. When the variance of the observation error approaches that which is typically estimated for assessment outputs, the same model-choice approaches tend to favor the single Beverton-Holt curve. For this and other reasons, it is argued that standard model-choice approaches are insufficient to make the case for a regime shift in the recruitment dynamics of western Atlantic bluefin tuna. A more fruitful course of action may be to move away from the current high/low recruitment dichotomy and focus instead on adopting biological reference points and management procedures that are robust to these and other sources of uncertainty.},

It examines implications of ignoring either effect and finds in all cases that true state dependence is an important determinant of location choice. Consequently, spatial policies like marine reserves can lead to differences in the short- and long-run behavioral responses of the fishing fleet. Under some specifications, random preference parameters are statistically significant when state dependence is excluded from the model, but when it is included, random preference parameters are not significant. In other specifications, including state dependence only dampens the variability in preference parameters.

The method is analogous to a two-stage nested design in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It considers the three-level hierarchical structure of a country: region-province-district, and decomposes overall regional inequality, as measured by Theil indices based on district-level mean incomes, into three components: the between-region, between-province, and within-province inequality components. The within-province component is a weighted-average of within-province income inequalities for each province, while the between-province component is a weighted-average of between-province income inequalities within each region. The method uses a district as the underlying regional unit to measure regional income inequality, rather than a province, and thus can analyze the contribution of within-province inequalities as well as between-province and between-region inequalities to the overall regional income inequality in a coherent framework. This paper applies the two-stage nested Theil decomposition method to district-level income and population data in China and Indonesia and explores factors determining regional income inequality in China and Indonesia.},

abstract = {The Nephrops trawl fishery is one of the most important fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30{\%} survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e.g. rent) are examined and a cost-benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bycatch is a nearly universal problem for fisheries, and it is increasingly common to place strict limits on allowable bycatch either on individuals or an industry sector. Individual bycatch quotas strengthen individual incentives to avoid bycatch and may reduce the likelihood that the bycatch cap will limit target species catch. However, in cases where bycatch is highly uncertain and variable, individual quotas and markets may be subject to high price variability and may fail to allocate quota efficiently. In some cases such as sea turtles, marine mammals, rare seabird and certain fish species, the allowable take may be less than one per permit holder. There are a number of reasons to believe that a transferable quota market may not function effectively in these cases. I explore the implications of stochasticity and uncertainty of bycatch for valuing quota in an individual bycatch quota system. I explore the degree to which a quota market increases expected profit and reduces individual risk relative to simply having a non-transferable individual bycatch quota, and how pooling approaches and possibly market insurance can be used to reduce financial risk for fishermen associated with uncertain bycatch. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Few non-experimental empirical studies shed light on contextual circumstances driving the extent of rent dissipation and overexploitation. We utilize a high-resolution data set to estimate a behavioral model of fishermen's spatial choices. A unique policy setting allows us to measure the degree to which individual fishermen's choices appear aimed at mitigating the tragedy of the commons in a small numbers setting. We find evidence of partial mitigation in excess of what we would expect under pure self-interest but short of what would occur under group-maximizing behavior. We also examine how contextual factors in the fishery shape the degree of cooperation within the fishing season and find evidence that competition for the common pool resource distorts fishermen's implicit cost of distance-creating a form of "common property inertia". ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In recent decades, the world's seafood markets have been exposed to a number of shocks due to increased production and globalization that led to growth in trade and new types of supply chains. While these changes have innluenced the species and sources studied by researchers who are investigating seafood demand, little attention has been given to how new species and producer countries induce structural changes in demand.

The Northern Adriatic Sea is considered a good case study by which to test this approach, given the richness of species landed there and their heterogeneous distribution across the space involved. Three groups of demersal species (whitefish, cephalopods, and crustaceans) are chosen for the study. First, geographical market boundaries are defined for each product (species) using price–price relations between market places. Second, demand is analyzed inside the defined market area through the linear approximation of the inverse almost ideal demand system. Geographical market integration bears several patterns of complete or partial integration, depending on the species. It could be said that integration is higher for species of high economic relevance among regions where large quantities are landed. For all product groups, our estimations suggest that moderate substitution effects do exist among species. The characteristics of the fleets and of the buyers, as well as the biophysical attributes of the sea basin (i.e., species richness and heterogeneous spatial distribution) are discussed as explanatory variables of market integration/segmentation.},

abstract = {The Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) continental shelf ecosystems show some similar and some distinctive groundfish biomass dynamics. Given that similar species occupy these regions and fisheries management is also comparable, similarities might be expected, but to what can we attribute the differences? Different types of ecosystem structure and control (e.g. top-down, bottom-up, mixed) can imply different ecosystem dynamics and climate interactions. Further, the structural type identified for a given ecosystem may suggest optimal management for sustainable fishing. Here, we use information on the current system state derived from food web models of both the EBS and the GOA combined with dynamic ecosystem models incorporating uncertainty to classify each ecosystem by its structural type. We then suggest how this structure might be generally related to dynamics and predictability. We find that the EBS and GOA have fundamentally different food web structures both overall, and when viewed from the perspective of the same commercially and ecologically important species in each system, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). EBS food web structure centers on a large mass of pollock, which appears to contribute to relative system stability and predictability. In contrast, GOA food web structure features high predator biomass, which contributes to a more dynamic, less predictable ecosystem. Mechanisms for climate influence on pollock production in the EBS are increasingly understood, while climate forcing mechanisms contributing to the potentially destabilizing high predator biomass in the GOA remain enigmatic. We present results of identical pollock fishing and climate-driven pollock recruitment simulations in the EBS and GOA which show different system responses, again with less predictable response in the GOA. Overall, our results suggest that identifying structural properties of fished food webs is as important for sustainable fisheries management as attempting to predict climate and fisheries effects within each ecosystem.},

Fishermen receive higher prices for fish, are guaranteed a stable income, and can activate political and regulatory support through direct interaction with consumers. Consumers are provided with access to high-quality novel types of fish and benefit from interactions with the producers of their food. CSFs have frequently collaborated with non-governmental organizations to address the challenges associated with these programs. Under the catch share system in the Northeast US groundfish fishery, sectors may be well-positioned to implement a CSF.

Most of the fisheries management systems in place worldwide employ technical measures based on control of inputs and outputs. For Europe, the European Commission is reforming the CFP legislative framework and has updated and amended the rules for technical measures (EU Regulation 2019/1241). This is particularly important for management systems in the European parts of the Mediterranean, where input measures play a major role, in contrast to management systems in the North East Atlantic, which uses mainly output measures (catch quota). We discuss here the main advantages and disadvantages of these instruments with a particular focus on the European part of the Mediterranean Sea, our main aim being to foster a debate on the best measures for fisheries management.},

Adoption can be contentious because of the assignment of wealth and political influence that accompany the transition to exclusive property rights. This paper studies how the early involvement of harvesters in policy implementation designed to address the commons' inefficiency may foster perceived legitimacy and lessen political opposition to the establishment of individual property rights. We demonstrate that it is optimal for a manager facing industry strife and reform delay to allow firms to self-select into the property rights regime. The strategic interaction of harvesters leads to an equilibrium characterized by the global adoption of property rights. Thus, by providing harvesters with a choice between management systems, policy makers can reduce the transaction costs associated with the need to create political consensus, while ensuring an outcome similar to the top-down implementation of market-based management. Evidence is provided from a recent policy change in Maryland fisheries in which the provision of a choice resulted in the overwhelming adoption of individual transferable quotas and the end of the race to fish.},

To evaluate the importance of this effect in the U.K. supermarket industry, we estimate a model of consumer choice and expenditure using three data sources: profit margins for each chain, a survey of consumer choices and a data-set of store characteristics. To permit plausible substitution patterns, the utility model interacts consumer and store characteristics. We measure market power by calculating the effect of merger and demerger on Nash equilibrium prices. Demerger reduces the prices of the largest firms by between 2 and 3.8{\%} depending on local concentration; mergers between the largest firms lead to price increases up to 7.4{\%}.},

We utilize a variety of approaches to examine the success of a voluntary conservation program for a common property resource. The availability of panel data and a nonparticipatory group lets us use quasi-experimental methods to investigate the distribution of outcome treatment effects. We supplement these methods by incorpo rating a difference-in-differences structure into a behavioral model of fishing location choice to disentangle the program's incentive effects from potentially misleading temporal variations in behav ioral constraints. Our findings yield insight into the factors that support cooperation and illustrate the power of the complementary use of structural and reduced form models in program evaluation. (JEL C21,Q22)},

However, handling zeros in the dependent and independent variable has remained obscure despite the prevalence of the situation. In this paper, we discuss how to deal with this issue. We show that using Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) is a good practice compared to other approximate solutions. We then introduce a new complementary solution to deal with zeros consisting in adding a positive value specific to each observation that avoids some numerical issues faced by the former.},

abstract = {The nature and impact of fishing on predators that share a fished resource is an important consideration in ecosystem-based fisheries management. Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill�predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species.},

Using decomposition of inequality by source, we examined how changes in particular income components affected overall inequality. Policies that increase fish yield in the study area have an important role to play in reducing poverty with negligible increase in income inequality. Increased income share from government jobs in lower income groups could play the dual role of alleviating poverty among relatively poor fish farmers and reducing income inequality among fish farming households in the study area.},

In this article we propose a variance estimator for the OLS estimator as well as for nonlinear estimators such as logit, probit, and GMM. This variance estimator enables cluster-robust inference when there is two-way or multiway clustering that is nonnested. The variance estimator extends the standard cluster robust variance estimator or sandwich estimator for one-way clustering (e.g., Liang and Zeger 1986; Arellano 1987) and relies on similar relatively weak distributional assumptions. Our method is easily implemented in statistical packages, such as Stata and SAS, that already offer cluster-robust standard errors when there is one-way clustering. The method is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way random effects model; a Monte Carlo analysis of a placebo law that extends the state-year effects example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) to two dimensions; and by application to studies in the empirical literature where two-way clustering is present.},

abstract = {The study of the geographical distribution of firms and of the dynamic pattern of firm entry and firm exits is a particularly relevant issue in regional health economics especially in the view of policy intervention to geographically balance health service supply and demand. The current state of the art in the study of new firm formation and firm exit (see, e.g., Armington and Acs, 2002; Folta et al., 2006; Andersson and Koster, 2011; Raspe and van Oort, 2011) collects a comprehensive set of empirical methodologies for data aggregated at the macro- (national) or meso- (e.g. regional) territorial levels, in which observations typically consist of the administrative units (such as regions, counties and municipalities). The lack of a systematic approach to the analysis of data at the micro-territorial level - where the observations refer to the geographical coordinates of each individual firm - has dramatically limited the possibility to obtain robust evidences about firm demography phenomenon mainly due to a problem of data scarcity and reliability. To overcome such limitations, in this article we propose an approach to the analysis of the spatial dynamics of firm formation/exit based on micro-geographic data. In particular, we illustrate the use of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function (Gabriel and Diggle, 2009) to detect the spatio-temporal clustering of firm entries and firm exits generated by the interaction between economic agents while controlling for common (locally varying) factors, spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In view of our aim the present paper shows the results of an empirical application of the methodology to the case of new firms entry and firm exit in the pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing industry during the years 2004-2009 in an Italian region (Veneto).},

abstract = {Marine biologists have shown virtually unqualified support for managing fisheries with marine reserves, signifying a new resource management paradigm that recognizes the importance of spatial processes in exploited systems. Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives. We demonstrate that optimistic conclusions about reserves may be an artifact of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch and discards, given the spatial heterogeneity of fish distributions. However, permanent fishing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial manage- ment tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a coman- agement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differ- ences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and reg- ulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spa- tial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has devel- oped spatial management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and with greater involvement of the fishing industry in designing and operating the tools.

abstract = {Economic models for hedonic markets characterize the pricing of bundles of attributes and the demand and supply of these attributes under different assumptions about market structure, preferences and technology. (See Jan Tinbergen, 1956, Sherwin Rosen, 1974 and Dennis Epple, 1987, for contributions to this literature). While the theory is well formulated, and delivers some elegant analytical results, the empirical content of the model is under debate. It is widely believed that hedonic models fit in a single market are fundamentally underidentified and that any empirical content obtained from them is a consequence of arbitrary functional form assumptions. The problem of identification in hedonic models is a prototype for the identification problem in a variety of economic models in which agents sort on unobservable (to the economist) characteristics: models of monopoly pricing (Michael Mussa and Sherwin Rosen, 1978; Robert Wilson, 1993) and models for taxes and labor supply (James Heckman, 1974). Sorting is an essential feature of econometric models of social interactions. (See William Brock and Steven Durlauf, 2001). In this paper we address the sorting problem in hedonic models. Nesheim (2001) extends this analysis to a model with peer effects. In this paper we note that commonly used linearization strategies made to simplify estimation and justify the application of instrumental variables methods, produce identification problems. The hedonic model is generically nonlinear. It is the linearization of a fundamentally nonlinear model that produces the form of the identification problem that dominates discussion in the applied literature. Linearity is an arbitrary and misleading functional form when applied to empirical hedonic models. Our research establishes that even though sorting equilibrium in a single market implies no exclusion restrictions, the hedonic model is generically nonparametrically identified. Instrumental variables and transformation model methods identify economically relevant parameters even 1 without exclusion restrictions. Multimarket data, widely viewed as the most powerful source of identification, achieves this result only under implausible assumptions about why hedonic functions vary across markets.},

abstract = {A management strategy evaluation framework was developed for the international Baltic cod fishery to evaluate the performance and robustness of the 2008 multi-annual management plan for the eastern stock. The spatially explicit management evaluation covered two cod recruitment regimes and various fleet adaptation scenarios. The tested management options included total allowable catch control, direct effort control, and closed areas and seasons. The modelled fleet responded to management by misreporting, improving catching power, adapting capacity, and reallocating fishing effort. The model was calibrated with spatially and temporally disaggregated landings and effort data from five countries covering 83 of the total cod catches. The simulations revealed that the management plan is robust and likely to rebuild the stock in the medium term even under low recruitment. Direct effort reduction limited underreporting of catches, but the overall effect was impaired by the increased catching power or spatio-temporal effort reallocation. Closures had a positive effect, protecting part of the population from being caught, but the effect was impaired if there was seasonal effort reallocation. Over the entire 15-year simulation period, all fleets could realize variable but positive profits under all scenarios tested, owing to stock recovery. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

An econometric analysis demonstrates that television ratings for NBA games are substantially higher when certain players (“superstars”) are involved. Thus, these superstars are quite important for generating revenue, not only for their own teams but for other teams as well. Using the econometric analysis and additional information on attendance and paraphernalia sales, we estimate the value of Michael Jordan to the other NBA teams to be approximately {\$}53 million. The positive externality superstars have on other teams can lead to an inefficient distribution of player talent. We examine several league policies that might be used to address the externality.

abstract = {Food availability is considered an important limiting factor in the breeding performance of marine birds, which exhibit restraint in reproductive life-history characteristics (e.g., delayed maturation, small clutch size, slow growth). Less well understood, however, is the extent to which taxonomic analogue species that breed in freshwater habitats are similarly regulated by food availability. Marsh-nesting Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) were studied from 2004 to 2008 at Horicon Marsh, a freshwater colony site in Wisconsin, USA, where reproductive success has been chronically poor. The adequacy of the food base to support a breeding colony of terns was evaluated (1) indirectly, through measures of breeding performance correlated with food availability during the egg-laying and incubation stages; and (2) directly, through a supplemental feeding experiment, conducted in 2004 and 2006, to determine whether nestling growth was limited by food availability. Clutch size, egg size, and adult body condition did not differ significantly among years, despite considerable annual fluctuation in environmental conditions and the rapid and extensive colonization of the wetland complex during the study period by a potential food competitor, American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). Growth rates of chicks were ∼10{\%} higher, on average, in 2006 than in 2004, but no difference was found in mean daily growth rates between food-supplemented and control chicks, nor did chick growth differ according to hatching order in the brood or hatching date. These results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor during the breeding season for Forster's Terns at Horicon Marsh, the only actively managed breeding site remaining for this species in Wisconsin.},

This article utilizes facility-level, cost-earnings data on shoreside processors in the Pacific whiting fishery to describe behavior before and after rationalization in 2011, where 20{\%} of the harvesting quota was allocated to processors. Predicted effects on processors centered on the potential for season lengthening to lead to increased ex-vessel prices and efficiency gains in the use of processing inputs, like labor and utilities. Data show longer seasons following rationalization, with processors paying higher ex-vessel prices as the ratio of ex-vessel to export prices fell. Estimated changes in efficiency match predictions directionally, but are not statistically significant, which may be due, in part, to the limited number of facilities and the range of other factors from which the impacts of rationalization must be disentangled.},

abstract = {The Global Ex-vessel Fish Price Database (Ex-vessel DB) reported in Sumaila et al. (J Bioecon 9(1):39-51, 2007) was the first comprehensive database that presents average annual ex-vessel prices for all commercially exploited marine fish stocks by nationality of the fishing fleet. It contained over 30,000 reported price items, covering the period from 1950 to the present, and supplemented missing prices with estimates based on prices from a different year, species group or fleet nationality. This paper describes a revised missing price estimation approach, focused on the computation of annual average international prices for each species group, adjusted to domestic prices using the real exchange rate based on national purchasing power parity. Key advantages of the new approach are that it allows a larger number of reported prices to be used in the price estimation, and accounts for relative price level differences that exist between countries. Our new approach should improve the estimates in regions where reported prices are scarce or non-existent by linking domestic prices to the trends in international prices. Our analysis, based on the revised ex-vessel price estimates (in real 2005 USD), shows that the global marine fisheries landings have generated total value of USD 4.2 trillion since 1950, including USD 100 billion in 2005.},

This paper explores the distinction between home-base and non-home location decisions in Portugal. We reach two important conclusions. First, the introduction of a variable accounting for prior base of economic activity significantly improves the statistical results. Second, we find that the weighting of distinct location attributes differs between home and non-home locations. Notably, non-home location choices are strongly governed by agglomeration economies and proximity to major urban centers, possibly replicating prior location decisions to economize on search costs. The results also enable us to quantify the investor's willingness to opt for a possible homefield advantage; for example, entrepreneurs accept over three times higher labor costs to compete in their resident area of business. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Economics of the fishery has focused on the wastefulness of common pool resource exploitation. Pure open access fisheries dissipate economic rents and degrade biological stocks. Biologically managed fisheries also dissipate rents but are thought to hold biological stocks at desired levels. We develop and estimate an empirical bioeconomic model of the Gulf of Mexico gag fishery that questions the presumptive success of biological management. Unlike previous bioeconomic life history studies, we provide a way to circumvent calibration problems by embedding our estimation routine directly in the dynamic bioeconomic model. We nest a standard biological management model that accounts for complex life history characteristics of the gag. Biological intuition suggests that a spawning season closure will reduce fishing pressure and increase stocks, and simulations of the biological management model confirm this finding. However, simulations of the empirical bioeconomic model suggest that these intended outcomes of the spawning closure do not materialize. The behavioral response to the closure appears to be so pronounced that it offsets the restriction in allowable fishing days. Our results indicate that failure to account for fishing behavior may play an important role in fishery management failures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A hedonic price model finds that the IFQ program had minimal direct effects on prices. A landings composition model finds that the IFQ program increased landings of the largest scallops. The Limited Access fleet, which lands most of the scallops in the region and is managed primarily with input controls, serves as a control for both models.

abstract = {A pervasive argument has emerged in debates over US ocean fishery policy that the policy-making process has generally been captured by commercial industry interests and consequently permits fishing quotas beyond sustainable harvesting levels. While it is clear that commercial interests are over-represented relative to recreational interests on the regional councils that set fishery policy, it is not clear whether commercial interests necessarily enact unsustainable policies. This paper examines the vote choices of representatives on the Pacific Fisheries Management Council by creating a spatial map of ideal point locations of voting members during the years 2006-2009 and then identifying voting coalitions. If a dominance by commercial interests leads to unsustainable policies, then it must be the case that members of this interest group vote as a cohesive and distinct bloc. In the end, however, it is shown that a geographic explanation for vote choices outperforms an interest group explanation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article utilizes a census of vessels before and after implementation of catch shares in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab fisheries to examine the short-run effects of catch shares on employment and remuneration of crew. The number of individuals employed declined proportionately to the exit of vessels following implementation. Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the postrationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.

abstract = {Rebuilding depleted fishery resources is a worldwide problem. In the U.S., the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSRA) of 2007 requires that "Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery...". However, translating this legal mandate into tangible goals and actions presents several technical challenges, especially for resources that have been chronically over-exploited. For example, maximum sustainable yields and biomass reference points are poorly estimated for stocks that have been overfished for a long period of time and are poorly defined unless sufficient data are available from periods of low-fishing mortality rates and relatively high-stock sizes. The conundrum of how to set meaningful rebuilding goals given limited information on the population dynamics and trophic interactions of a rebuilt stock can generally be addressed through adaptive management procedures incorporating learning about density-dependent population dynamics. Monitoring changes in life history parameters and recruitment is critical for successful rebuilding strategies realizing the full yield potential of rebuilt stocks while periodic re-evaluation of rebuilding targets is also needed to address uncertainties due to density dependence, trophic interactions or environmental factors. This paper summarizes the development and implementation of goals and strategies to rebuild New England groundfish stocks over the past decade. Management is particularly challenging because the true yield and population size potentials of these interacting stocks is unknown due to chronic overfishing throughout the modern history of the fishery, uncertainty in compensatory/depensatory population dynamics and in the degree of stationarity in environmental control of groundfish recruitment.},

abstract = {The Eastern Bering Sea fishery for pollock is one of the largest fisheries in the world and has often been touted as an example of sustainable fisheries management. Yet, sustainability requires more than protection of the biological productivity of the targeted fish species. It requires preservation of the flows of net social and economic benefits of the fishery, and flexible governance and management institutions that allow for adaptation to changes in fish abundance as well as changes in consumer demand and in the prices of key inputs. From an economic perspective, the Alaska pollock fishery was unsustainable before passage of the American Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1998. The AFA permanently divided the pollock Total Allowable Catch (TAC) giving a 10{\%} allocation to the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program and partitioning the remainder among four fishing sectors. It allowed CDQ to be leased to any sector but largely prohibited leasing or sale between other sectors. These limits on intersectoral transfers have reduced the ability of sectors to respond to changes in the abundance and distribution of pollock, implementation of management measures intended to benefit other species, and changes in the prices of input factors and products. This paper explores these consequences. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {* Conservation science increasingly focuses on how ecosystem functioning is affected by anthropogenic pressures, which implies an understanding of the structural and functional changes in biological assemblages and requires indicators to detect such changes within a suitable time frame. * A novel approach that combines the spatial analysis of fishing gradients (based on vessel monitoring system records) with distance-based linear models was used to assess the response of several functional and structural metrics of fish assemblages to gradients of trawling, within four distinct habitat types. In addition, critical thresholds of trawling intensity were identified for the most sensitive metrics through piecewise regression models. * Overall, total biomass and dominance (i.e. number of species that make up 90{\%} of the total biomass) metrics as well as metrics representing vulnerable features (such as chondrichthyes, species with very low resilience and sedentary species) were shown to be sensitive to fishing. Our results suggest that decreasing trends in these indicators are likely to be associated with direct and indirect fishing effects acting synergistically on specific features of fish assemblages leading to its homogenization, with likely impacts on ecosystems resilience. * Critical thresholds at high, medium and low fishing intensity levels were identified depending on the metric used to assess fishing impacts, suggesting that it is difficult to define a single global target for fishing management as it ultimately will depend on management and conservation objectives (e.g. maintenance of biomass vs. maintenance of structure and function). * Synthesis and applications. A key goal of the applied approach was to provide short-term indicators that are sensitive to gradients of trawling intensity and can be extrapolated to a broader geographical region. The identification of thresholds of fishing pressure that fish assemblages can withstand before ecosystem functioning is altered is key for the development of indicators as warning mechanisms, as well as to assess performance measures for management. Understanding responses to other pressure sources (e.g. pollution, dredging) requires further research, and combining an integrative functional traits approach with a wider range of pressures may help make this achievable.},

One exception is the British Columbia, Canada, groundfish trawl fishery, where individual transferable quotas govern total allowable catches (TACs) for 22 species, combined with 100{\%} observer coverage and the deduction of discard mortality from quota. Despite the number of species covered, when TACs were increased for some species and reduced for others, fishers were able to adjust the species mixture in their catches. The top 34 vessels frequented a wide range (mean 38, range 20-69) of "fishing opportunities" (repeated trawls along the same track line) containing predictable species mixtures. When TACs for rougheye (Sebastes aleutianus), shortraker (Sebastes borealis), and yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) were sharply cut, fishers avoided fishing opportunities where these species were more abundant. More generally, their choice of fishing opportunities depended on the expected multispecies composition, although other factors were probably also important. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

The trade data is organized along four dimensions: Geographical market (import), production technology, species, and product form.

In addition we compare the volatility of fish prices to other commodities to investigate their volatility in a broader context. Given the importance of trade in fisheries and aquaculture, our analysis also sheds light on the relative importance of price risk as part of trade revenue risk and the riskiness of various fish enterprises at the market level.

After 35 years of management, groundfish stock sizes and catches are lower than when management began. We argue that in New England, the groundfishing industry is caught in a prisoner's dilemma caused by a large number of interactive social, political, and economic variables. These factors have (1) motivated fishermen to oppose the rules promulgated by the government (which we call the “harvest game”) and (2) lowered the benefits of investing in rules to conserve fish stocks (which we call the “rule game”). In both games, fishermen are motivated to play their dominant strategy to the detriment of the industry, conservation, and fish stocks. We suggest that the dilemma will only be solved by a change in the culture of the industry that would lead to support for a conservation ethic. Unfortunately, the current institutional framework of management does not support the development of such an ethic. Rational-choice theory and concepts from evolutionary game theory add to our understanding of the dilemma facing those concerned with groundfish management in this region.},

abstract = {Socioeconomic considerations should have an important place in reserve design. Systematic reserve-selection tools allow simultaneous optimization for ecological objectives while minimizing costs but are seldom used to incorporate socioeconomic costs in the reserve-design process. The sensitivity of this process to biodiversity data resolution has been studied widely but the issue of socioeconomic data resolution has not previously been considered. We therefore designed marine reserves for biodiversity conservation with the constraint of minimizing commercial fishing revenue losses and investigated how economic data resolution affected the results. Incorporating coarse-resolution economic data from official statistics generated reserves that were only marginally less costly to the fishery than those designed with no attempt to minimize economic impacts. An intensive survey yielded fine-resolution data that, when incorporated in the design process, substantially reduced predicted fishery losses. Such an approach could help minimize fisher displacement because the least profitable grounds are selected for the reserve. Other work has shown that low-resolution biodiversity data can lead to underestimation of the conservation value of some sites, and a risk of overlooking the most valuable areas, and we have similarly shown that low-resolution economic data can cause underestimation of the profitability of some sites and a risk of inadvertently including these in the reserve. Detailed socioeconomic data are therefore an essential input for the design of cost-effective reserve networks.},

abstract = {Here, we synthesize conceptual frameworks, applied modeling approaches, and as case studies to highlight complex social-ecological system (SES) dynamics that inform environmental policy, conservation and management. Although a set of "good practices" about what constitutes a good SES study are emerging, there is still a disconnection between generating SES scientific studies and providing decision-relevant information to policy makers. Classical single variable/hypothesis studies rooted in one or two disciplines are still most common, leading to incremental growth in knowledge about the natural or social system, but rarely both. The recognition of human dimensions is a key aspect of successful planning and implementation in natural resource management, ecosystem-based management, fisheries management, and marine conservation. The lack of social data relating to human-nature interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission, which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience, complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions, emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection challenges as well as modeling challenges.},

A precondition for sustainable and efficient fisheries management systems is that the imposed regulations can be controlled and enforced. Furthermore, the management costs shall be reasonable compared to the economic output to be obtained from the fisheries. The analytical framework is based on hypotheses from economic and sociological theories, i.e.: (a) fishers' compliance is determined by economic gains of breaking the rules compared to the risk of being detected, (b) compliance is also determined by the design of the management system and whether the imposed regulations are perceived as legitimate. This relates to both the procedures under which the regulations have been decided and to the contents of the regulations, and (c) institutions play a significant role in coordinating various interests in fisheries management and is further a mean to reduce high transaction costs in fisheries management. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Particular attention was devoted to investigating the performances of the fishery with regard to three features identified as major impacts in the literature: rationalization of the fishing fleet, change in fishing strategy in order to maximise the fisher's profit and concentration of fishing rights and activity. On average, the fishery reacted as expected and reached its objective in terms of reconstruction of the biomass, but the overall assessment in terms of resulting profitability is not very conclusive. There is no evidence of decrease of the profitability over the period of the study but the fishery is more reactive to external factors on its export market in China than to changes in its own structure. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences,.},

After decades of overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks have recovered, a change brought about through effective management. We provide a synthetic overview of three approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and community-level outcomes. For each approach, we present prominent case-studies that illustrate behaviour and the corresponding performance. These case-studies show that sustaining target stocks requires a hard limit on fishing mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems for allocation allow stakeholder communities to strike a locally acceptable balance between profitability and employment.},

abstract = {Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM), or co-management, emerged in Bangladesh as an alternative arrangement for the management of water bodies to solve the adverse effects of the government leasing policy on fishers and fishery resources. As a result of the continuation of the traditional leasing system, the elites and influential individuals captured and controlled the water bodies, and, as a consequence, low income individual lost their rights to fish and work in these water bodies. In 1995, the Bangladesh Department of Fisheries initiated a new management system called CBFM where local poor people were involved in the management process and received rights to fish in the common property water bodies. This study examined the impact of the CBFM-2 project on the income, expenditure and inequality of the fishing community and determines the relationship between poverty and inequality. Following simple random sampling, a representative sample of 196 fisher households comprising 101 CBFM (target) fishers and 95 non-CBFM (control) fishers were selected from Hakaluki and Halir haors of the Moulouvibazer and Sunamgonj districts, respectively. A propensity score matching method was used for impact evaluation. The results show that the CBFM-2 project has a positive and significant impact on fisher's income and household expenditure when poor fishers are involved in the co-management system. The results also reveal that inequality is not a major problem in the study areas, and no significant changes in the income and expenditure distribution has taken place following the project implementation. Finally, the results reveal that inequality and poverty are negatively related in the study area. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Decades of lobby-ing by the U.S. fishing industry against foreign fishing and seafood imports caused Congress to extend federal jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977. Scallop fishermen initially earned high profits for their efforts, but by about 1990 the overcapitalized fishery was surviving on new year classes. Limited access and a stock rebuilding program were introduced in 1994, but an asymmetric distribu-tion of potential gains in favor of relatively few, multi-permit companies has preoccupied public debate on the transferability and consolidation of fishing rights. Rent-seeking by the limited-access permit holders is now also focused on claims by the growing open-access sector of the scallop fishery, groundfish bycatch limitations, and gear-induced habitat damage, which has drawn law-suits from environmental organizations.},

The assumption was constant underlying resource availability. Now, an advanced version considers the underlying size-based dynamics of the targeted stocks for Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic Sea fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process is specific to the vessel catching power and to the encountered population abundances, based on disaggregated research survey data. The impact of the effort displacement on the fish stocks and the vessels' economic consequences were evaluated by simulating individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds, and ports. Some scenarios led to increased energy efficiency and profit while others such as fishing closures or fishermen optimization sometimes lowered the revenue by altering the spatiotemporal effort allocation. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the interactions between vessels or to the alteration of individual patterns. We demonstrate that integrating the spatial activity of vessels and fish abundance dynamics allow for more realistic predictions of fishermen behaviour, profits, and stock abundance.},

These recommendations consider the use of SP methods to estimate both use and non-use (passive-use) values, and cover the broad SP domain, including contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments. We focus on applications to public goods in the context of the environment and human health but also consider ways in which the proposed recommendations might apply to other common areas of application. The recommendations recognize that SP results may be used and reused (benefit transfers) by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and that all such applications must be considered. The intended result is a set of guidelines for SP studies that is more comprehensive than that of the original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Blue Ribbon Panel on contingent valuation, is more germane to contemporary applications, and reflects the two decades of research since that time. We also distinguish between practices for which accumulated research is sufficient to support recommendations and those for which greater uncertainty remains. The goal of this article is to raise the quality of SP studies used to support decision making and promote research that will further enhance the practice of these studies worldwide.

abstract = {Among countries colonized by European powers during the past 500 years, those that were relatively rich in 1500 are now relatively poor.We document this reversal using data on urbanization patterns and population density, which, we argue, proxy for economic prosperity. This reversal weighs against a view that links economic development to geographic factors. Instead, we argue that the reversal re?ects changes in the institutions resulting from European colonialism. The European intervention appears to have created an “institutional reversal” among these societies, meaning that Europeans were more likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for the reversal in relative incomes. We provide further support for this view by documenting that the reversal in relative incomes took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of the opportunity to industrialize.},

abstract = {The drift and exchange of sea scallop larvae (Placopecten magellanicus) on Georges Bank is investigated by tracking particles in three-dimensional flow fields consisting of the semidiurnal tidal current and autumn mean circulation on realistic topography. Three composite flow fields are considered, each forced by non-linear tidal current interactions, seasonal-mean density gradients and seasonal-mean wind stress. The around-bank flow rates are in approximate agreement with the observed residual gyre, while the cross-isobath currents in the flow fields are consistent with observations only in being generally weak. In most cases it is unclear whether the discrepancies arise from observational uncertainties or from model approximations. In the simulations the particles are given the behavior and planktonic period expected of sea scallop larvae. Particle starting positions correspond to the three major scallop aggregations: the Northeast Peak (NEP), the Southern Flank (SF), and the Great South Channel (GSC). Simulations are run to examine the sensitivity of the particle trajectories and settlement numbers to aspects of larval biology (vertical distribution, ascent and descent rates, search times, growth and mortality rates), and to various flow field components. The pattern and extent of larval exchange and settlement are most sensitive to the duration and depth of planktonic drift, gyre strength, weak cross-isobath flow, and mortality rate. The simulations indicate significant larval exchange among the three aggregations, with self-seeding possible for the GSC and NEP, and unlikely for the SF. Given the high retention of particles on Georges Bank as a whole (10-73{\%} before mortality), Georges Bank scallops should be considered self-sustaining. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Quota allocation mechanisms have distributional effects that are highly relevant to the economic organization of fisheries. In France, where fishing allocations are non-transferable, quotas are shared among Producer Organizations (POs) based on the historical landings of their members. Each PO is then responsible for implementing their own internal rules that provide individual or collective allocations to their members. This study investigates the distributional effects of the various quota management systems adopted by POs on quotas and production for the Bay of Biscay sole fishery. A comparison between initial allocations by vessel based on historical landings and actual observed landings is presented. Inequality metrics are used to quantify distributional effects, and a new method that is based on the decomposability property of the Theil index is introduced. Results show that the French management system successfully avoided concentration of production while reducing the fishing capacity through decommissioning schemes. The non-transferability of fishing allocations is a critical element that favored this outcome by allowing POs to control the distribution of catch shares in the fishery. Besides, it appears that the allocation strategies developed by POs were notably influenced by their local roots and their fishing fleet profiles. The various quota allocation systems among POs had contrasting effects on vessels' production, including greater equity within particular subfleets, benefits to vessels most dependent on sole in most POs, and benefits to the small-scale fisheries in a few POs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to estimation and inference in panel data models with a general multifactor error structure. The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.},

abstract = {MSY objectives are being adopted as major fisheries management targets worldwide. However, in fisheries where discards account for an important share of the catches, the yield, effort, and biomass at MSY can be significantly different when accounting or not for discards and thus when, basing the yield estimations on landings or catches. Also whether accounting for a certain survival rate, of discards can lead to different MSY targets estimates. Hence, both decisions have important, implications on catch and effort reduction recommendations, and consequently on the quota, calculations for fisheries managed by quotas. Results from the Bay of Biscay nephrops fishery confirm, that the optimal exploitation level can vary significantly when optimising for catches or landings, and, by assuming a certain survival rate of the discards. By doing this, the present study also allows to, explore the basis to clarify the definition of MSY in fisheries where discarding takes place. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The complexity of small-scale fisheries makes it difficult to predict the allocation of fishing effort among alternative target species in mixed fisheries, resulting in limitation for fisheries management. One reason for the diffi- culty is that fishing effort has been assumed as an aggregate of different components, without consideration of fishers' decisions. In this paper, we use discrete choice models to identify factors involved in fishers' decisions about selecting target species on a daily basis. We analyze catch data, by species and fisher, from three fishing communities of Yucatan, Mexico, to contrast the following models: (i) random selection, (ii) economic motivation, and (iii) changes in resource availability. Our results show that fishers do not operate at random but consider information on resource avail- ability and revenues generated from previous trips before selecting or shifting a target. We compare the results among communities and also use the proposed models to predict changes in fishing effort levels given changes in species price and catch per unit effort. We stress the importance of understanding fishers' behavior when it comes to developing ap- propriate management policies.},

abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and socialpsychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s, supply augmentation strategies to meet water needs have waned, and governments have increasingly focused on demand management measures, including voluntary water transfers. Water demands have also changed as expanding urban growth, changes in agriculture, and increasing concern for the environment compete for water. Water rights regimes based on queuing principles lead to an inefficient allocation of water resources and may also result in other inefficiencies, such as overuse of land and inadequate adoption of capital-intensive conservation technologies. Water trading based on transferable water rights has been advanced as a solution to these problems. Trading helps equalize the marginal prices faced by various water users, thereby providing information about the value of water in alternative uses and creating compatible incentives. Putting water markets into practice introduces real-world complications of transaction costs and third-party externalities. We present these complications along with some major criticisms of water markets, and actual cases of water trading are discussed. We conclude with avenues of potential future research.

abstract = {Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) management systems are typically introduced to promote better capital utilisation by the fishing fleet and other efficiency gains. ITQ management was introduced in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998 and led to a range of economic, social and cultural changes including an increasing proportion of the catch taken by fishers dependent on quota leasing. Quota owners who lease out their entire quota increasingly dominated ownership of the fishery. Temporal changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics were analysed, which showed that the lease quota trade network has become more integrated and the influence of personal connections less important. Change in the network structure of the market indicated that a smaller number of quota owners have become increasingly dominant in this market although there was no evidence that this had an effect on quota lease prices. Processors also participated in the lease quota market and influenced interactions and dependencies. In other jurisdictions processor relationships have been found to affect lease quota price developments. However, disproportionate quota ownership by processors and market manipulation did not occur here. This was due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through investment in quota, another logical way of gaining it would be for processors to operate as pseudo brokers and distribute lease quota for quota owners. Although processors in Tasmania operate as pseudo brokers, the absence of structural changes in the processor market indicated that this produced no change in market power or quota owner loyalties. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

For the whole period, the IGE shows a Ushape across the income distribution, with maximum values at the tails (0.66 at the 10th percentile and 0.48 at the 90th percentile) and a minimum value –highest mobility- of 0.37 at the 70th percentile. These values contrast with the Ordinary Least Square estimate, which is 0.47. The trend evolution of the IGE varies also across the income distribution. While for all percentiles up to the median (and OLS) the trend of IGE was decreasing in the 80s and 90s and slightly increasing in the 00s, the IGE remained relatively stable for the richer along the whole period. With respect to the channels of intergenerational income transmission, son's education and race were found to be important.},

This paper undertakes a quantitative review of the empirical literature on agglomeration through a meta-analysis of 729 elasticities taken from 34 different studies. The objective is to make sense of the range of values for agglomeration economies found in the literature by identifying some key characteristics that affect the magnitude of the results obtained. Our analysis confirms that study characteristics do matter. In particular, we find that country specific effects, the industrial coverage, the specification of agglomeration economies, and the presence of controls for both unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity and differences in time-variant labor quality can give rise to large differences in the results reported in the literature. In contrast, correcting for reverse causality of agglomeration does not seem to produce noticeable changes in the size of urban agglomeration estimates. We also test for publication bias and find some evidence supporting the presence of positive reporting bias. The findings support the intuition that agglomeration estimates for any particular empirical context may have little relevance elsewhere.},

Using data from Northeast U.S. Fisheries for the fishing years 2010-2014, we show that the traditional representation of fishing activities as derived by speed rules leads to a severe misrepresentation of fishing grounds for gears other than bottom otter trawl. Predictions based on probability models outperform the simple speed rule in classifying VMS polls for sink gillnet and scallop dredge trips, gears with more complicated patterns of fishing than bottom otter trawlers, without adding substantial computational effort. While the speed rule tends to perform well for the classification of bottom otter trawl fishing locations, the probability model described performs at least as well in terms of prediction, and provides added value in terms of a conditional probability of fishing for each VMS poll, which can be used to weight these polls in research extensions. We also highlight issues, such as fleet dynamics, that historically have not been dealt with in the static speed rules most often used to predict fishing locations, but which can have significant impacts on the quality of predictions, and are most easily controlled for in a formal probability model.

Overall changes are related to changes in subgroup shares and changes in subgroup densities, where the latter are broken down further using elementary transformations of individual incomes. These density decompositions are analogous to the widely-used decompositions of inequality indices by population subgroup, except that they summarize multiple features of the income distribution (using graphs), rather than focusing on a specific feature such as dispersion, and are not dependent on the choice of a specific summary index. Nonetheless, since inequality and poverty indices can be expressed as PDF functionals, our density-based methods can also be used to provide numerical decompositions of these. An application of the methods reveals the multi-faceted nature of UK income distribution trends during the 1980s.},

We built a spatially explicit biological and economic model of the fishery to analyze the trade-offs between maintaining given levels of fish biomass and the net financial returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results of the scenarios we modeled suggested that a decrease in total allowable catch at high levels of harvest either increased net returns or lowered them only slightly, but increased biomass by up to 10{\%} for a wide range of reserve sizes and an increase in the reserve area from none to 16{\%} did not greatly change net returns at any catch level. Thus, catch shares and no-take reserves can be complementary and when these methods are used jointly they promote lower total allowable catches when harvest is relatively high and encourage larger no-take areas when they are small.},

abstract = {We used a simulation model to examine the effect of area closures and fishing effort on the two main target species of the Great Barrier Reef Coral Reef Finfish Fishery: common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus). Area closures had greater effect on the more sedentary coral trout, in the areas outside the closures and accessible to the fishery, and little effect on red throat emperor, which was assumed to move among reefs. The effects of effort levels were greater than area closures on the harvest of both species and were seen not only in the areas accessible to the fishery, but also in the biomass of red throat emperor in the areas closed to the fishery. The catch and biomass resulting from a given effort level did not appear to have an equivalent effect attributable to any area closure. Although the effects of effort levels and area closures are confounded in reality by the coincidental implementation of area closures and restructuring of the fishery, the simulation model separated these factors to show that the closures under the 2004 rezoning should have had minimal effect on total-stock biomass and that a greater effect would result from changes in fishing effort.},

abstract = {World food prices hit an all-time high in February 2011 and are still almost two and a half times those of 2000. Although three billion people worldwide use seafood as a key source of animal protein, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations-which compiles prices for other major food categories-has not tracked seafood prices. We fill this gap by developing an index of global seafood prices that can help to understand food crises and may assist in averting them. The fish price index (FPI) relies on trade statistics because seafood is heavily traded internationally, exposing non-traded seafood to price competition from imports and exports. Easily updated trade data can thus proxy for domestic seafood prices that are difficult to observe in many regions and costly to update with global coverage. Calculations of the extent of price competition in different countries support the plausibility of reliance on trade data. Overall, the FPI shows less volatility and fewer price spikes than other food price indices including oils, cereals, and dairy. The FPI generally reflects seafood scarcity, but it can also be separated into indices by production technology, fish species, or region. Splitting FPI into capture fisheries and aquaculture suggests increased scarcity of capture fishery resources in recent years, but also growth in aquaculture that is keeping pace with demand. Regionally, seafood price volatility varies, and some prices are negatively correlated. These patterns hint that regional supply shocks are consequential for seafood prices in spite of the high degree of seafood tradability.},

Gini and Herfindahl-Hirschman indices indicate the distribution of shares is highly unequal, but shareholders do not have market power. The absence of quota overages and lower aggregate discard levels suggest resource stewardship improved.

abstract = {Because ofthe extreme uncertainty in fisheries biology, efforts to determine a stock-recruitment relationship have not been entirely successful. In the face of this uncer-tainty, this paper argues for a change in focus for fisheries economics from bioeconomic optimization toward goals which are more modest and more easily achievable. In particular, a satisficing approach to management is advocated, whereby ef-forts are made to reallocate some porportion of effort from overutilized to underutilized fisheries, with no attempt to de-termine the optimum. In order to achieve such a solution efficiently, managers must accurately predict the response of fishermen to public policy. This paper reports on a study which develops a discrete choice model to predict fishermen's supply response. Fishermen are shown to respond to economic incen-tives of expected returns and variability of returns, but only after these incentives surpass a substantial threshold. The Argument for Behavioral Modeling Uncertainty permeates the fishery management problem. This paper attempts to deal with the complexities arising from a},

To this end, it distinguishes between root, conditional, and internal drivers of price changes using three empirical models: (1) a price spike model where monthly food price returns (spikes) are estimated against oil prices, supply and demand shocks, and excessive speculative activity; (2) a volatility model where annualized monthly variability of food prices is estimated against the same set of variables plus a financial crises index; and (3) a trigger model that estimates extreme values of price spikes and volatility using quantile regressions. The results point to the increasing linkages among food, energy, and financial markets, which explain much of the observed food price spikes and volatility. While financial speculation amplifies short-term price spikes, oil price volatility intensifies medium-term price volatility. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

@techreport{DFO-Canada2013a,
abstract = {The sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, is found only in the Northwest Atlantic, from Cape Hatteras to Labrador. Scallops are aggregated in patches and harvestable concentrations are called beds. Major areas of offshore fishing activity are Browns Bank, Browns Bank, German Bank, the Eastern Scotian Shelf (Banquereau, Middle Bank, Sable and Western banks), and St. Pierre Bank (south of Newfoundland). Scallops prefer a sandy, gravel bottom and occur in depths of 35 to 120 m on the offshore banks. The offshore scallop fleet consists of wet fish vessels and freezer-trawlers. Generally, these vessels simultaneously fish two New Bedford offshore rakes, ranging from 4.3 to 5.2 m width, one on each side of the vessel. Annual assessments of the status of the offshore scallop resource take into account the annual survey findings, meat size distribution in the catch, and fishery performance. The management of the main scallop fishery on Browns Bank refers to the northern part of the bank (Fig. 1). Browns Bank south is a marginal growth area for scallops and has separate management measures. The assessment and advice presented in this document use the assessment framework established in 2009 for Browns Bank. In support of management of the Browns Bank north 2013 scallop fishery, a meeting of the Science Advisory Process was held 1 May 2013 at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, N.S., to: (1) assess the status of the resource; and (2) provide harvest advice for the 2013 fishery. Maritime Region Assessment of Browns Bank North Scallop 2 SUMMARY • The 2012 TAC was 500 t for Browns Bank north and total reported landings were 475 t. • The commercial catch rate in 2012 was at the long-term median (1991-2009). • In 2012, the survey index for pre-recruits was similar to what it was in the early 2000s and well below the 21-year (1991-2011) median. The 2005 year-class is now mainly fully recruited to the fishery and survey indices of recruit and fully recruited scallops were near their respective 21-year (1991-2011) median levels. • The overall condition factor for Browns Bank north in May 2012 was 11.83 g/dm 3 . This was an increase from 11.03 g/dm 3 in 2011 but is still below the long term mean of 12.62 g/dm 3 . • Fully recruited biomass, estimated to be 5,950 t in 2012, increased slightly from the 2011 estimate (5,504 t) and is approximately equal to the 21-year median biomass of 5,807 t • The 2013 interim TAC of 750 t will result in an exploitation rate of 0.13. Biomass is expected to remain relatively stable, however there is little indication of strong year classes in the near future. • Harvest scenarios ranging from 200 t to 1000 t were examined and all had moderate (0.40-0.56) probability of decline in commercial biomass for 2013. Biomass change ranged from 9 to -5 {\%} for the range of catches considered here.},

@article{hill_strategic_2013,
abstract = {SUMMARY The goals of ecosystem based management (EBM) are strategically ambiguous, meaning that they require interpretation to identify objectives for ecosystem state. Ecosystem states that are useful for achieving such objectives are known as reference points. Soft reference points specify both a state and a probability of the ecosystem being in that state. They are used with simulation models to identify management measures for which the risk of the ecosystem entering an undesirable state is below a specified level. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is responsible for the EBM of Antarctic krill fisheries. CCAMLR used soft reference points for the krill stock in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage to set a regional catch limit. However, this catch limit needs spatial subdivision to protect predators from localized depletion. Model-based evaluations of different options for subdividing the catch limit used illustrative reference points to assess the depletion risk to multiple predators. This study demonstrates that the apparent risk is sensitive to the choice of reference point and method for aggregating modelled predators. EBM practitioners and stakeholders need to be aware that these factors could therefore bias comparisons of management measures. Nonetheless, qualitative distinctions between different spatial subdivision options are relatively consistent except at high levels of aggregation and extreme reference points. This study also demonstrates a lack of generality in the relationship between current and future ecosystem state. Thus, the EBM goal of maintaining ecosystem resilience implies different reference points for the current state of different ecosystem components. Despite early progress in defining soft reference points for the krill stock, CCAMLR has not yet defined reference points for krill predators. Structured dialogue aimed at identifying collective objectives might be necessary to achieve further progress in CCAMLR and other EBM organizations.},

@article{Ayers2018,
abstract = {Rights-based management approaches are being increasingly applied to global fisheries as an alternative to deficiencies associated with centralized or top-down management. In fisheries, these approaches may include a diversity of methods such as catch shares, territorial user rights for fishing, individual transferable quotas, fisheries concessions, cooperatives, and comanagement. Many of these approaches are being implemented in small-scale fisheries contexts, without full consideration of how the legacy of previous governing institutions or tenure arrangements may affect implementation. Likewise, few case studies examine whether rights-based management approaches are appropriate for given contexts, examine how they fit within a nested administrative hierarchy, or describe their shared property rights components in practice. These knowledge gaps may obscure key stewardship incentives, veil existing power relations, and constrain opportunities for different management models while also prolonging or preventing governance transformations. We illustrate the importance of these factors through a case study of institutional change in coral reef fisheries in Hawaiʻi. We use institutional analysis to examine coral reef fisheries management across two time periods: historical marine tenure in the Hawaiian Kingdom (1810–1893) and under contemporary centralized management (1982–2018). We then compared these management regimes to emerging comanagement in Hawaiʻi (1994–2018). Our analysis reveals that few rights are actually devolved to communities seeking to implement comanagement. We also highlight considerable administrative complexity and variability within historical marine tenure regimes. We conclude by considering several issues relevant to the performance of rights-based approaches such as comanagement, including devolution of property rights to the local level, matching administrative and social-ecological complexity, the importance of historical context and narratives in shaping solutions, and the perceived legitimacy of governance arrangements.},

The distribution function for daily precipitation was assumed to be exponential. Analytic expressions are derived for the distribution functions for total precipitation or precipitation greater than a threshold. For the numerical example chosen, the Markov chain-exponential model is slightly superior to the binomial-exponential model.

abstract = {The importance of fish size for price per kilo is studied using an inverse demand approach. Price per kilo in different size categories of the same species differs significantly. This means that the average price for a species may change due to e.g., high grading or a changing climate, which both have the potential to change the size composition of the catch. Estimates show that quantity flexibilities differ substantially across size and species, while scale flexibilities, in general, are close to homothetic. Holding total catch constant, an ap- proximate 1{\%} decrease in the largest size category and a corresponding increase in the smallest size cate- gory is estimated to reduce the value of an average week's catch by roughly 0.1–0.4{\%}. The results imply that the effect of size on price is an important consideration when formulating regulations or policies to curb, for example,high grading.},

abstract = {We analyse the impact of improved chickpea adoption on welfare in Ethiopia using three rounds of panel data. First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.},

abstract = {Most worldwide fish stocks are overexploited, and so exploited beyond the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the Maximum Economic Yield (MEY). Not exploiting fisheries resources at MSY or MEY leads to the loss of production and rents from the fisheries. A large part of the EU fisheries are managed based on single species stock assessments; however, in reality, most species are caught together with other species and by different fleets. In multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries, single species assessments, and consequently MSY and MEY reference points, are often not valid, and so the catch recommendations. In this paper it is investigated the MSY and MEY estimation in multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries in comparison to single species assessments. Analyses are applied to the Bay of Biscay demersal fishery using the IAM bio-economic model. The impact of exploiting at MSY and MEY on the optimal effort allocation between fleets with different exploitation patterns and economic structures is analyzed. When accounting for the multi-species nature of the fishery, MSY landings are 0.4{\%} to 2.7{\%} lower than the single species simulations estimates. When accounting for the multi-fleet nature of the fishery, MSY landings are 27.2{\%} to 30.2{\%} higher than the single-fleet estimates. When considering the multi-fleet characteristics, MEY landings are 6.6{\%} higher and profits are 66.5{\%} higher than in the single-fleet simulation. Optimal effort at MEY is lower than at MSY, but when accounting for multi-fleet the optimal effort decreases for some fleets while increases for gillnetters. The results also provide an estimation of the profits at MEY (or costs of not being at MEY). Profits can be then up to 10.7 times larger than the current profits (256 million Euros compared to the current 24 million Euros). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The anal- ysis takes advantage of the extensive Danish IDA data which provides wage infor- mation on the entire working population in a 27-year period. We find that the major part of wage dispersion in the Danish labor market can be explained by differences inworker characteristics. However, the relative contributions of the three components vary across subgroups of workers. The match effect constitutes a non-negligible part of the overall wage dispersion. An analysis of inter-industry wage differentials shows that firm characteristics are more important at the industry level than at the worker level. Similarly, we find evidence that high-wage workers tend to sort into high-wage industries to a larger extent than they sort into high-wage firms within industries. The mobility pattern of workers is related to the quality of the firm and thematch. Finally, we find that firms' wage policies differ across subgroups},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision- makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case- studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

abstract = {Differentiated products are the central economic focus of competition in consumer goods products such as cereal, soda, and beer. We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff{\'{e}}renciation des produits est un aspect {\'{e}}conomique central de la concurrence sur les march{\'{e}}s des biens de consommations comme les c{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}ales, les sodas ou les bi{\`{e}}res.

However, recent threats raise the question whether the industry will be able to respond to future threats as successfully as it has to ones in the past or whether it is now less resilient and can no longer adequately respond to threats. Through ethnographic research and oral histories with fishermen, we examined the current level of social resilience in the lobster fishery. We concentrated on recent threats to the industry and the ways in which it has responded to them, focusing on three situations: a price drop beginning in 2008, a recovery in 2010–2011, and a second collapse of prices in 2012. In addition, we considered other environmental and regulatory concerns identified by fishermen. We found that the industry is not responding effectively to recent threats and identified factors that might explain the level of social resilience in the fishery.},

Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacentwaters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries.At these small scales, localfisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale fished stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

Amongst the key results, it is found that saving and investment are correlated for China for both the period of the fixed exchange rate and the entire sample period. With high saving-investment correlation, the results suggest that the Chinese econ-omy is in conformity with the FH hypothesis. This is a valid outcome, for in China capital mobility was fairly restricted over the 1952–1994 period as indicated by the relatively low foreign direct investment.},

The technique does not require fishing cost or ex-vessel price data and employs social network analy-sis metrics (namely degree centrality and constraint) to measure access to information and network posi-tion for buyers and sellers. Our method is applied to the Gulf of Mexico red snapper quota lease market and finds that certain quota lease traders with larger information-sharing networks or stronger network posi-tions have greater negotiating power. Also, average quota lease prices varied by region even though there are no geographic trading restrictions. Results indicate social networks are correlated with price dispersion and inefficiencies in the trading markets that can undermine the success of catch share programs that seek to improve fishery profits and reduce overcapacity.},

abstract = {A growing number of US fisheries are managed with catch share programs, which allocate exclusive shares of the total allowable catch from a fish stock to individuals, cooperatives, communities, or other entities. All of these catch share programs allow transferability of catch privileges in some form. Information on these transfers, particularly prices, could be valuable to fishery managers and to fishery participants to support management and business decisions and to increase efficiency of the catch share market itself. This article documents the availability and quality of data on transfers of catch privileges in fourteen US catch share programs. These catch share programs include several individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs and a number of programs that allocate catch privileges to self-organized cooperatives. Price information on catch share transfers is found to be limited or unavailable in most US catch share programs. Recommendations are made on how to improve the design of catch share programs and associated data collection systems to facilitate effective catch share markets, collection of catch share market data, and better use of information from catch share markets.},

abstract = {Male and female spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias were collected in the western North Atlantic Ocean in the Gulf of Maine between July 2006 and June 2009. Squalus acanthias ranged from 25 to 102 cm stretch total length and were caught during all months of the year except January. Age estimates derived from banding patterns visible in both the vertebrae and second dorsal-fin spines were compared. Vertebral growth increments were visualized using a modified histological staining technique, which was verified as appropriate for obtaining age estimates. Marginal increment analysis of vertebrae verified the increment periodicity, suggesting annual band deposition. Based on increased precision and accuracy of age estimates, as well as more biologically realistic parameters generated in growth models, the current study found that vertebrae provided a more reliable and accurate means of estimating age in S. acanthias than the second dorsal-fin spine. Age estimates obtained from vertebrae ranged from {\textless}1 year-old to 17 years for male and 24 years for female S. acanthias. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth model fit to vertebrae-derived age estimates produced parameters of L∞ = 94{\textperiodcentered}23 cm and k = 0{\textperiodcentered}11 for males and L∞ = 100{\textperiodcentered}76 cm and k = 0{\textperiodcentered}12 for females. While these growth parameters differed from those previously reported for S. acanthias in the western North Atlantic Ocean, the causes of such differences were beyond the scope of the current study and remain to be determined.},

abstract = {The spatial lag of X model, a linear regression model extended to include explanatory variables observed on neighboring cross-sectional units, is the simplest spatial econometric model producing flexible spatial spillover effects and the easiest model to parameterize the spatial weights matrix, denoted by W, describing the spatial arrangement of the units in the sample. Nevertheless, it has received relatively little attention in the theoretical and applied spatial econometrics literature. This study fills this gap by considering several extensions of its basic form. It is found that the claim made in many empirical studies that their results are robust to the specification of W is not sufficiently substantiated. Especially the spatial spillover effects, often the main interest of spatial economic and econometric studies, turn out to be sensitive to the specification of W. In addition, it is found that the common practice to adopt the same W for every spatial lag should be rejected. These findings are illustrated using a cigarette demand model based on panel data of 46 U.S. states over the period 1963 to 1992.},

These metrics provide an initial data set for descriptive analyses of fishing community status and for exploratory analyses to identify hypotheses for subsequent in-depth study of the socioecological dynamics of Alaskan fishing communities. Metrics were derived by collating information from publicly available databases and include information on fishing portfolios, fishing revenues, fishermen demographics, and fleet characteristics. As demonstration of the community metrics, we examine metric trends in detail for three communities (Kodiak, Sitka, and Togiak), and provide state-wide temporal and spatial assessments to characterize historical dynamics of Alaska's fishing communities. Statewide assessments show synchrony in the dynamics of some metrics, such as increasing population, declining permit ownership, and improving per-fishermen gross revenues, but show considerable variation amongst communities for other metrics, such as the diversification of communities' fishing portfolios and investments into fleets. Spatial distributions of metrics suggest the western and northern parts of Alaska have experienced greater declines in metrics associated with commercial fisheries importance and performance relative to the southern and eastern regions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite this computational advantage, in the linear model, the score bootstrap stu-dentized test statistic is equivalent to that of the conventional wild bootstrap up to order O p (n −1). We establish the consistency of the procedure for Wald and Lagrange Multiplier type tests and tests of moment restrictions for a wide class of M-estimators under clustering and potential misspecification. In an extensive series of Monte Carlo experiments we find that the perfor-mance of the score bootstrap is comparable to competing approaches despite its computational savings.},

The SAMs are constructed in an innovative way that allows for the economic dependency and utilization of natural resources, especially marine resources, to be examined in detail. The SAM utilizes data from a mix of publically available secondary sources and data collected directly from local governments. The SAMs are then subjected to an economic base analysis to develop indices of economic dependence. The results of this study indicate that while fishing and fish processing are no lon-ger a major source of gross measures of output, employment, wages, or gross regional product (GRP) in any state or even county on the West Coast; from an economic ex-port income perspective cities such as Westport, Washington are heavily dependent on these industries for their economic base.},

abstract = {Both old and new information on the biology and ecology of Atlantic bluefin tuna have confronted scientists with research challenges: research needs to be connected to current stock-assessment and management issues. We review recent studies on habitat, migrations and population structure, stressing the importance of electronic tagging results in the modification of our perception of bluefin tuna population dynamics and behaviour. Additionally, we question, from both scientific and management perspectives, the usefulness of the classical stock concept and suggest other approaches, such as Clark's contingent and metapopulation theories. Current biological information confirms that a substantial amount of uncertainty still exists in the understanding of reproduction and growth. In particular, we focus on intriguing issues such as the difference in age-at-maturity between West Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna. Our description of Atlantic bluefin tuna fisheries places today's fishing patterns within the two millennium history of exploitation of this species: we discuss trap fisheries that existed between the 17th and the early 20th centuries; Atlantic fisheries during the 1950s and 1960s; and the consequences of the recent development of the sushi–sashimi market. Finally, we evaluate stock status and management issues since the early 1970s. While important uncertainties remain, when the fisheries history is confronted with evidence from biological and stock-assessment studies, results indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna has been undergoing heavy overfishing for a decade. We conclude that the current exploitation of bluefin tuna has many biological and economic traits that have led several fish stocks to extreme depletion in the past.},

Three recent papers purport to show that the role of geography in explaining cross-country patterns of income per capita operates predominantly or exclusively through the choice of institutions, with little direct effect of ge ography on income after controlling for the quality institutions. This note shows that malaria transmission, which is strongly affected by ecological conditions, directly affects the level of per capita income after controlling for the quality of institutions},

We develop a spatially explicit bioeconomic model which is used to examine the effects of an acute pollution event. Two scenarios are considered, both involving a prohibi- tion on shellfish harvesting in the area affected by pollution, but distinguished according to the freedom given to vessels to move out of the affected area. The model suggests that closing an area to fishing may have widespread economic repercussions if it is linked biologically or technically with others. The decision to allow or disallow boats to move from an affected area is shown to make a crucial difference in the level and variability of profits in the fishery system as a whole.},

IncreasingGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would reverse more than 70{\%} of the decline in mobility.

In this article we investigate to what extent this development has influenced the price transmission process for two product forms: a relatively unprocessed one (fresh fillets) and a more processed one (smoked salmon). Results indicate that the supply chain for fresh fillets can still be characterized by a high degree of price transmission. On the contrary, the hypothesis of full price transmission for smoked salmon is rejected.},

@article{Wetzel2017,
abstract = {U.S. federal fisheries managers are mandated to obtain optimum yield while preventing overfishing. However, optimum yield is not well defined and the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has often been applied to provide an upper bound for the optimum yield value, but determining the MSY, identifying the relative biomass that produces MSY and the associated fishing rate required (FMSY) is difficult. The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages groundfish stocks off the U.S. west coast, has employed proxy targets in lieu of species-specific estimates of MSY, BMSY, and FMSY. The proxy targets are life history specific, with flatfish stocks managed using a target BPROXY of 0.25 of unfished biomass and a harvest control rule that applies an exploitation rate equal to a spawner-per-recruit harvest rate of F0.30, with a linear reduction of catch to zero if the stock falls below 5{\%} of unfished biomass (BLIMIT). A management strategy evaluation was performed to explore the performance of the current harvest control rule applied to flatfish stocks to meet management goals, along with alternative harvest control rules that explore varying the values for BPROXY BLIMIT, and FSPR. Each of the harvest control rules explored maintained stocks at or near BPROXY when stock-recruit steepness was 0.85 or greater, with very low probabilities of reducing relative biomass below a minimum stock size threshold (set at 0.50 BPROXY of each harvest control rule). The most aggressive harvest control rule, which applied a BPROXY of 0.20 and a target harvest rate of F0.25, led to fishing rates that exceeded the operating model FMSY values for low steepness (0.75), reducing the stock below BPROXY with catches exceeding MSY. Trade-offs exist among alternative harvest control rules where the more aggressive harvest control rules resulted in higher average catches, but with an increase in the average annual variation in catches and a decrease probability of the relative biomass being with 10{\%} of the BPROXY. The trade-offs among the performance metrics and alternative harvest control rules coupled with the risk to the resource across a range of life histories should be carefully considered by fishery managers when selecting a harvest control rule that will meet the goals of management.},

abstract = {Global concerns about CO2 emissions, national CO2 quotas, and rising fuel prices are incentives for the commercial fishing fleet industry to change their fishing practices and reduce fuel consumption, which constitutes a significant part of fishing costs. Vessel-based fuel consumption, energy efficiency (quantity of fish caught per litre of fuel used), and profitability are factors that we simulated in developing a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) for fishing vessel movements. The observed spatial and seasonal patterns of fishing effort for each fishing activity are evaluated against three alternative effort allocation scenarios for the assumed fishermen's adaptation to these factors: (A) preferring nearby fishing grounds rather than distant grounds with potentially larger catches and higher values, (B) shifting to other fisheries targeting resources located closer to the harbour, and (C) allocating effort towards optimising the expected area-specific profit per trip. The model is informed by data from each Danish fishing vessel {\textgreater}15m after coupling its high resolution spatial and temporal effort data (VMS) with data from logbook landing declarations, sales slips, vessel engine specifications, and fish and fuel prices. The outcomes of scenarios A and B indicate a trade-off between fuel savings and energy efficiency improvements when effort is displaced closer to the harbour compared to reductions in total landing amounts and profit. Scenario C indicates that historic effort allocation has actually been sub-optimal because increased profits from decreased fuel consumption and larger landings could have been obtained by applying a different spatial effort allocation. Based on recent advances in VMS and logbooks data analyses, this paper contributes to improve the modelling of fishing effort allocation, fuel consumption and catch distribution on a much disaggregated level compared to the fleet-based models we developed so far. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Price volatility in green certificate markets reflects uncertainty over future prices, representing a major source of risk for renewable energy generators. Price risk is considered the principal deficiency of this market-based policy since it causes investors to require higher returns. Moreover, investors are exposed to regulatory risk; namely, the risk that a change in the regulation will materially impact the certificate price. Regulatory uncertainty is reflected in market volatility exacerbating certificate price risk. Using an econometric approach, we investigate the role of regulatory changes on price volatility in the Swedish certificate market. The results of our analysis indicate that regulatory changes strongly affect certificate markets, resulting in periods of higher volatility. Moreover, we analyze whether certificate price volatility has changed after creating a joint Swedish/Norwegian market. Results indicate that the ambivalence surrounding the creation of this bigger market led to a period of increased price volatility between 2010 and 2011. Overall, this article brings a better understanding of the role of regulatory uncertainty on certificate markets, and gives evidence for its negative impact in terms of increased price volatility. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to examine any impact of MSC certification on the KDSFF, this study examines structural changes in the market. Since no immediate impact of price premium changes can be realized, structural break tests and cointegration tests are conducted. The monthly ex-vessel price of flathead flounder in the Kyoto market is compared with those in the two adjacent uncertified markets. The structural break tests detected a significant impact two months after the KDSFF's certification. The cointegration and Granger causality tests showed that the Kyoto market was previously influenced by other larger markets, but has become less subject to their influence after introduction of MSC certification.},

Fishers may be viewed as individual foragers, whose decisions are aimed at optimizing short-term gain, as in ideal free distribution (IFD) theory. Although IFD assumes all foragers to be equal, they are likely to differ in competitive abilities for different prey types or target species. Here, we present an IFD-like model of a fishing fleet consisting of two components with different competitive abilities for two target species, showing that spatial segregation can result from unequal interference competition, but also in the absence of interference competition. Differences in catch efficiency between vessels for target species in combination with differences in the spatial distribution of target species can result in spatial segregation among vessel groups. The theoretical results are used to interpret the observed spatial segregation of two components within the Dutch beam trawl fleet using observations from a vessel monitoring by satellite system. However, this study cannot pinpoint which of the processes included in the theoretical model is the prime cause of the segregation within the Dutch beam trawl fleet.},

abstract = {Fisheries models usually characterise the concentrations of fish and the distribution of the fishing fleet by spatial averages over large areas assuming homogeneous spatial characteristics. Many important management questions, such as those related to the spatial effects of closed areas, cannot be addressed by such models. This paper presents a model which describes the spatial movement of individual fish schools and the spatial response of individual fishing boats, and which can be applied on a much finer scale and thus can be used to analyse the scale-dependent development of the fishery. The motion of the fish is based on assumptions about time-dependent gradients in the relative attractiveness of nearby grid cells which motivate migrations based on feeding and spawning factors. The motion of fishing boats is modelled in a similar fashion, with the attractiveness of neighbouring cells based on historical catch records as a function of position and time of year, as well as whether current catch rates are high enough to justify staying in the same cell. Our model showed that marine reserves increase fish biomass but decrease fish catches. It is also indicated that marine reserves are of limited use when not combined with quotas of catches. Our findings also point that transfer rates of fish increase the benefits of marine reserves in terms of fish biomass but decrease fish catches. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We examine fishers' responses to the introduction of tradable harvest rights for protected species, 'bycatch rights,' in the US West Coast groundfish fishery, finding evidence of adjustment along several margins and estimating the marginal cost of conservation. Fishers adapted to bycatch rights by changing fishing location, gear, time of day fished, and duration of fishing activity. As a result, catches of protected species fell dramatically. The nuanced nature of fishers' responses indicates that the least-cost way of achieving conservation goals can involve fine-tuned behavioral adaptations that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with command-and-control regulation.},

This shift will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.},

@article{Conrad2012,
abstract = {Abstract Beginning in the 1960s, ecologists, mathematicians, and economists started developing a class of models, which today are referred to as bioeconomic models. These early models started with a difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of a biological resource. To this equation one might add a second difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of “harvesting effort.” Alternatively, one could formulate a dynamic optimization problem seeking to maximize discounted net benefit. These models provided important insights into the tragedy of the commons and policies that might promote optimal management. By the 1970s, more complex models were developed incorporating multispecies interactions, age-structured populations, and models with stochastic growth. In the late 1990s, spatial bioeconomic models were developed in recognition of the importance of location when managing biological resources. The objectives of this survey are to: (i) review some of the early models in bioeconomics, (ii) present some of the key spatial models in bioeconomics that have been used to assess the value of marine (no-take) reserves, and (iii) speculate on the direction of future research in spatial bioeconomics.},

SUMMARY This paper proposes new tests for detecting the presence of a unit root in quite general time series models. Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey {\&} Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE)is an effective tool to evaluate the performance of harvest control rules (HCRs)and alternative management strategies. However, a comprehensive MSE framework advising management is still absent for the severely depleted Gulf of Maine (GoM)cod (Gadus morhua). In the present study, we developed a conceptual MSE framework and conditioned on this stock utilizing stock-specific parameterization. We highlighted the simulation of a few key processes with semi-independent sub-models and accounted for uncertainties from multiple sources. The simulated population dynamics was calibrated and validated against the historical trend in hindcasting. Forecasting simulations were also conducted and validated to examine the effectiveness in the context of uncertainty. Hindcasting results suggested that the calibrated MSE framework could capture the stock dynamics assuming different recruitment dynamics indicated by residuals lower than 5{\%}. Forecasting stochastic runs demonstrated a minor disparity between management effects of fishing-mortality-based and catch-based HCRs when the segregated stock recruitment relationship was adopted with a difference in simulated spawning stock biomass lower than 10{\%}. Additionally, the results were comparable to assessment and projections made in the stock assessment, indicating the robustness of the framework. The framework can potentially help disentangle complex issues related to the mixed fishery, decision-making, and performance evaluation of a monitoring system.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are increasingly seen as a way to make fisheries more profitable and halt over-capitalisation. ITQs allocate to users of a resource a share of a total allowable catch (TAC) which they are free to use, lease, or sell. We outline an approach to modelling the effect of an ITQ system in a multi-species, multi-sector fishery and apply it to the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF) in Queensland, Australia. An ITQ model, based on the assumption that operators seek to maximize profits, simulates the use of tradeable quota units by operators in the fishery, taking account of the initial quota allocation to operators, seasonal fish prices and individual operator variable costs, their fishing efficiency and experience, and constraints on vessel movements. Rationalization of the fishery is predicted to occur under an ITQ system for the CRFFF, which will lead to reductions in effort, increases in profits, and changes over time in quota prices. The ecological consequences of transferable quota in the multi-species fishery are seen in the catch and discard levels of the less profitable species, even though a TAC was set. This had flow-on effects on biomass. For example, simulations showed that the TAC for the primary target species, coral trout, was used more fully than that for a less valuable target species, red throat emperor, and that this was achieved through increased discarding of red throat emperor. Catches of both coral trout and red throat emperor that were derived from the model were higher than those recently observed in the fishery. The effort predicted by the model, however, closely approximated the actual effort observed in the fishery following implementation of ITQ management. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Research toward the impacts of climate change and human activities on marine ecosystems is challenged by the limitations of present-day ecosystem models to address the interrelated spatial dynamics between climate, ocean chemistry, marine food webs, and human systems. The work presented here, the spatial-temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial-temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

By removing the anonymity axiom, such framework is able to evaluate the individual income changes over time and the reshuffling of individuals along the income distribution that are determined by the pattern of income growth. We adopt a rank dependent social welfare function expressed in terms of initial rank and individual income change and we obtain partial and complete dominance conditions over different growth paths. These dominance conditions account for the different components determining the overall impact of growth, that is the size of growth and its vertical and horizontal incidence. We then provide an empirical application for Italy: this analysis shows the distributional impact of the recent economic crisis suffered by the Italian populaltion.},

These matrices were used to predict the annual growth of the scallops, which were compared with direct observations of growth obtained by repeated sampling. Additionally, the observed growth of the scallops was used to estimate the parameters of a stochastic von Bertalanffy model for each site, which were used to estimate the mean annual growth increments as a function of starting shell height. These were compared with the mean growth increments on the shells. There was a close correspondence, in most cases, between the observed growth and the growth in ferred from the shell rings, implying that the shell rings were formed annually. The lack of fishing mortality in the areasmeant that there was no confounding of size-selective fishing with growth and allowed us to track cohorts longer than would otherwise have been possible.},

abstract = {In fisheries managed using individual transferable quotas (ITQs) it is generally assumed that quota markets are well-functioning, allowing quota to flow on either a temporary or permanent basis to those able to make best use of it. However, despite an increasing number of fisheries being managed under ITQs, empirical assessments of the quota markets that have actually evolved in these fisheries remain scarce. The Queensland Coral Reef Fin-Fish Fishery (CRFFF) on the Great Barrier Reef has been managed under a system of ITQs since 2004. Data on individual quota holdings and trades for the period 2004-2012 were used to assess the CRFFF quota market and its evolution through time. Network analysis was applied to assess market structure and the nature of lease-trading relationships. An assessment of market participants' abilities to balance their quota accounts, i.e., gap analysis, provided insights into market functionality and how this may have changed in the period observed. Trends in ownership and trade were determined, and market participants were identified as belonging to one out of a set of seven generalized types. The emergence of groups such as investors and lease-dependent fishers is clear. In 2011-2012, 41{\%} of coral trout quota was owned by participants that did not fish it, and 64{\%} of total coral trout landings were made by fishers that owned only 10{\%} of the quota. Quota brokers emerged whose influence on the market varied with the bioeconomic conditions of the fishery. Throughout the study period some quota was found to remain inactive, implying potential market inefficiencies. Contribution to this inactivity appeared asymmetrical, with most residing in the hands of smaller quota holders. The importance of transaction costs in the operation of the quota market and the inequalities that may result are discussed in light of these findings.},

abstract = {Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consist- ent with each other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and me ´tiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding effort reductions are applied.},

abstract = {Harvest control rules (HCRs) are used in fisheries management to reduce fishing mortality as the level of perceived risk to the fish stock increases. This is typically done by adjusting fishing mortality rates based on estimated stock status relative to operational control points (OCPs). OCPs represent the stock status level at which management responses are taken. OCPs differ from biological reference points (BRPs), which represent biomass targets to be achieved, or low biomass thresholds to avoid. Both BRPs and OCPs can be based on theoretical quantities such as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR), or unfished spawning biomass (B0). However, they can also be based on quantities such as the estimated average spawning biomass and fishing mortality during a productive period. Formal evaluation of the performance of HCRs that account for potential biases in estimated model parameters and stock status relative to OCPs can help managers and stakeholders select HCRs expected to provide acceptable outcomes and trade-offs. We use closed-loop simulation to evaluate the performance of five HCRs for two British Columbian groundfish stocks for which there is considerable uncertainty in underlying productivity: Hecate Strait Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and Hecate Strait Rock Sole (Lepidopsetta spp.). Performance metrics representing ecological and economic fishery objectives are reported for two alternative productivity scenarios for each stock, including depensatory mortality for Pacific Cod, and alternative levels of natural mortality (M) for Rock Sole. We present an algorithm for calculating equilibrium M in the presence of density-dependence, and show general effects of uncertainty in M on reference point calculations. Mechanisms for differences in performance among alternative HCRs are explored, and we show that even when model parameters or OCPs are very biased, some HCRs can still produce desirable management outcomes. We show that trade-off considerations are important because differential sources of stock assessment bias between the two species, and between scenarios within a given species, meant that no single HCR performed consistently. We suggest that prospective evaluation of alternative harvest policies using closed-loop simulation could be conducted routinely on a stock-specific basis, and can facilitate choice of HCRs, with a focus on outcomes rather than uncertainty per se.},

Although exit rates from the lowest income groups remain relatively high even when spells of low income have lasted a number of years, there is evidence of farms with persistent low farm income and farms experiencing repeated spells of low-income. Smaller farm size and having a farmer aged over 65 increase both the probability that a farm will fall into the lowest income group and the length of time spent in that income group. Further the results suggest that the impact of the post-1997 agricultural recession on income mobility depended on the income status of the farm when the recession began.},

The study examines quota transaction behaviours from Scotland's ten industry membership groups, known as Producer Organisations (POs), by analysing their annual ‘Production and Marketing Plans'. Integrating data from the government Fixed-Quota Allocation (FQA) database, and official ‘quota-use' records, the analysis pieces together previously ‘unknown knowledge' surrounding quota exchanges, in the UK offshore pelagic and whitefish sectors. Leasing and barter transactions are pervasive among those with access to quota, although a core-group of POs dominate pelagic opportunity. These dynamics suggest consolidation to a point of inefficiency, given the dependence of marginal POs in Scotland's rural areas upon marine fisheries capture and processing. Inclusive participatory scenario-modelling techniques may now offer equitable options, in a new era of fisheries management.},

In principle, this is a highly competitive market in which there should be no predictable price differences across customers who are equally costly to service. The results indicate that different buyers pay different prices for fish of identical quality. For example, Asian buyers pay 7{\%} less for whiting than do white buyers, a result which is inconsistent with the model of perfect competition.},

abstract = {The distributional incidence of growth is generally analyzed by comparing the quantiles of the pre- and post-growth income distribution—e.g. the so-called Growth Incidence Curves. Such an approach based on an implicit re-ranking of individual incomes ignores income mobility by assuming that only post-growth income matters in social welfare. By contrast, this paper takes the view that “status quo matters” and that social welfare should logically be defined on both inital and terminal income. This leads to consider 'non-anonymous' Growth Incidence Curves that plot income growth rates against the various quantiles of the initial distribution. Dominance criteria that generalize those available for standard growth incidence curves are derived, which account for the inequality of individual income changes, conditional on initial income. An application to the cross-country distributional feature of global growth illustrates the analysis.},

abstract = {Commercial fishers are constantly exposed to many risk factors, making it a dangerous occupation. Fisheries management that limits access and catches can give rise to well-known stock and rule-of-capture externalities known as the “race to fish.” This market failure dissipates rents and can lead fishers to take on additional risks such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels, or delaying maintenance to outcompete others. Rights-based management is expected to reduce the incentives to take on additional risk. Using a large dataset of fishers from around the United States, we empirically estimate the effects of individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs on one important risk factor: the decision to fish in poor weather. We find that risk-taking behavior generally decreases under IFQs, but the magnitude of the shift differs by fishery, and we explore potential drivers of these differences.},

Focusing on three economic channels dis-cussed in the literature, I investigate whether resource abundance slows down indus-trialization or the accumulation of education, or whether it raises inequality. I exam-ine these channels using geological variation in oil abundance in the Southern United States. In 1890 oil abundant counties were mostly agricultural and similar to other nearby counties, but after oil was discovered they began to specialize in its produc-tion. From 1940-1990 oil abundant counties developed a manufacturing sector that was smaller in terms of its share of employment, but not in terms of its absolute size. At the same time, these counties enjoyed a better educated workforce and higher per capita income, and attracted population at a faster rate. By 1990 these advantages had di-minished, but oil abundant counties still had slightly higher per capita income without suffering from worse inequality. Taken together, my results suggest that while resource based specialization involves some long term costs, it can serve as an important lever for development.},

In April 2011, as part of a reform process aimed at giving fishers more flexibility, vessels using active gear were given annual non-transferable catch quotas. We examine whether the new management systemhas altered the bargaining power between fishers and processors in the ex-vessel market for fish. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach we find that postreform fishers improve their bargaining power and thus are paid a higher price. However, the price increase is small, amounting to around 2{\%} of the pre-reform price.},

We document a continuous and sizable increase in wage inequality over the sample period. Changes in the distribution of hours worked sharpen the rise in earnings inequality before 1982, but mitigate its increase thereafter. Taxes and transfers compress the level of income inequality, especially at the bottom of the distribution, but have little effect on the overall trend.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Fish and Fisheries published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Marine ecosystems evolve under many interconnected and area-specific pressures. To fulfil society's intensifying and diversifying needs while ensuring ecologically sustainable development, more effective marine spatial planning and broader-scope management of marine resources is necessary. Integrated ecological–economic fisheries models (IEEFMs) of marine systems are needed to evaluate impacts and sustainability of potential management actions and understand, and anticipate ecological, economic and social dynamics at a range of scales from local to national and regional. To make these models most effective, it is important to determine how model characteristics and methods of communicating results influence the model implementation, the nature of the advice that can be provided and the impact on decisions taken by managers. This article presents a global review and comparative evaluation of 35 IEEFMs applied to marine fisheries and marine ecosystem resources to identify the characteristics that determine their usefulness, effectiveness and implementation. The focus is on fully integrated models that allow for feedbacks between ecological and human processes although not all the models reviewed achieve that. Modellers must invest more time to make models user friendly and to participate in management fora where models and model results can be explained and discussed. Such involvement is beneficial to all parties, leading to improvement of mo-dels and more effective implementation of advice, but demands substantial resources which must be built into the governance process. It takes time to develop effective processes for using IEEFMs requiring a long-term commitment to integrating multidisciplinary modelling advice into management decision-making.},

The Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) closes the area between depth contour based boundaries to commercial trawl fishing. In this analysis, commercial fishing vessels are grouped based on their level of fishing effort within the closed area prior to the closure in order to compare changes in effort levels between groups. The results suggest that the RCA may have had a small effect on the level of fishing effort in the California groundfish trawl fishery. Spatial distribution of fishing effort before and after implementation of the marine reserve is also compared. Some concentration of effort occurred along parts of the closed area boundaries. This pattern suggests the "fishing the line" behavior noted in the marine reserve literature, but other possible explanations exist including the effects of coincident changes in other regulations and changing bioeconomic conditions. {\textcopyright}2012.},

There also is a persistent growth impact from the large-scale famine in the 1980s, as well as substantial externalities from road infrastructure. The persistent effects of rainfall shocks and the famine crisis imply that welfare losses due to the lack of insurance and protection measures are well beyond the welfare cost of short-term consumption fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, harvester decisions impact the economic performance of co-dependent processing firms. This paper incorporates both sectors in an analysis of the effect of ITQs on commercial fisheries. Results show that, as a consequence of season elongation under a harvester-only allocation of fishing rights, capital nonmalleability implies that processor quasi-rents will be redistributed to harvesters. These losses could promote political gridlock and jeopardize adoption of an ITQ policy unless they are fully compensated or unless redistribution is avoided by a policy-superior initial allocation of rights to both harvesters and processors.},

In fisheries, market-based management is found mainly in the "cap-and-trade" systems known as individual transferable quotas (ITQs). ITQs are effective in achieving certain economic goals but often with undesirable social costs, leading to the view that they are antithetical to community-based management. However, ITQ systems have been adapted to mitigate community losses. In addition, social resistance to ITQs has encouraged the development of innovative programs in community-based fisheries management.

Our method is applied to the Gulf of Mexico red snapper quota lease market and finds that certain quota lease traders with larger information-sharing networks or stronger network posi-tions have greater negotiating power. Also, average quota lease prices varied by region even though there are no geographic trading restrictions. Results indicate social networks are correlated with price dispersion and inefficiencies in the trading markets that can undermine the success of catch share programs that seek to improve fishery profits and reduce overcapacity.},

abstract = {This article utilizes a census of vessels before and after implementation of catch shares in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab fisheries to examine the short-run effects of catch shares on employment and remuneration of crew. The number of individuals employed declined proportionately to the exit of vessels following implementation. Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the postrationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.

One exception is the British Columbia, Canada, groundfish trawl fishery, where individual transferable quotas govern total allowable catches (TACs) for 22 species, combined with 100{\%} observer coverage and the deduction of discard mortality from quota. Despite the number of species covered, when TACs were increased for some species and reduced for others, fishers were able to adjust the species mixture in their catches. The top 34 vessels frequented a wide range (mean 38, range 20-69) of "fishing opportunities" (repeated trawls along the same track line) containing predictable species mixtures. When TACs for rougheye (Sebastes aleutianus), shortraker (Sebastes borealis), and yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) were sharply cut, fishers avoided fishing opportunities where these species were more abundant. More generally, their choice of fishing opportunities depended on the expected multispecies composition, although other factors were probably also important. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

The optimal utilization of quotas is thus dependent on development of an efficient quota market, but markets in multispecies IFQ fisheries develop slowly and may fail to perform efficiently even after several years. In 2011 an IFQ system was implemented for the Pacific groundfish trawl fishery in the US. After four years, the quota market does not appear to be yielding effi-cient prices for many species or distributing quota efficiently. I explore the structure and performance of the QP market and discuss the impediments to market efficiency. Drawing from theory and experience in other multi-species IFQ systems, I discuss other quota distribution and catch-balancing mechanisms that can supplement and perhaps improve inefficient markets and enable higher quota utilization rates.},

We introduce an analytical model with firm heterogeneity to distinguish between traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners, and inframarginal rent, which accrues to those with high skill. We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry. In our application to an important US fishery, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource, but without substantial free grandfathering, the top harvesters would rationally oppose the transition to property rights.},

The approach allows us to undertake both an ex post evaluation of short-term impacts of ITQs and an ex ante evaluation of longer term impacts. With respect to short-term impacts, the results suggest that larger vessels have benefited the most from the introduction of ITQs, but that all vessels have enjoyed increases in the prices received for those fish species that are included in the quota program.

Here, the assumption that an ITQ-regime will lead to an immediate reduction of catch capacity and discourage investment in the fisheries seems questionable, as the ITQ-regime seems to represent an input of "new" capital into the fisheries. As a result of quota leasing arrangements, tenancy relations have developed between parts of the coastal fleet and companies with large quota holdings. Crew wages have in these cases dropped, a situation that has provoked two strikes among fishermen. The demand for quotas is influenced by unemployment and lack of alternative sources of income for fishermen. Municipalities are in a number of cases significant participants in the quota market, as there are strong ties between companies and municipalities. A redistribution of wealth and income is taking place as a result of the system. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Between 2007 and 2011. inflation-adjusted dockside, allocation (leased quota), and quota share prices rose by 7{\%}, 37{\%}, and 145{\%}, respectively, suggesting the profitability of the fleet improved. Gini and Herfindahl-Hirschman indices indicate the distribution of shares is highly unequal, but shareholders do not have market power. The absence of quota overages and lower aggregate discard levels suggest resource stewardship improved. However, discards in the eastern Gulf remain high due to stock range expansion and insufficient allocation. This article also describes lessons learned from the five-year review.},

abstract = {Can a perishable food commodity with strong seasonal variation in supply, supplied by producers with limited operational radius, belong to a spatially integrated market? The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.},

First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.},

abstract = {Commercial fishers are constantly exposed to many risk factors, making it a dangerous occupation. Fisheries management that limits access and catches can give rise to well-known stock and rule-of-capture externalities known as the “race to fish.” This market failure dissipates rents and can lead fishers to take on additional risks such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels, or delaying maintenance to outcompete others. Rights-based management is expected to reduce the incentives to take on additional risk. Using a large dataset of fishers from around the United States, we empirically estimate the effects of individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs on one important risk factor: the decision to fish in poor weather. We find that risk-taking behavior generally decreases under IFQs, but the magnitude of the shift differs by fishery, and we explore potential drivers of these differences.},

abstract = {Fisheries managers have increasingly adopted rights-based management (i.e., “catch shares” or “individual transferable quotas” [ITQs]) to address economic and biological management challenges under prior governance regimes. Despite their ability to resolve some of the symptoms of the tragedy of the commons and improve economic efficiency, catch shares remain controversial for their potentially disruptive social effects. One criticism is that the benefits of rights-based reforms are unequally distributed across vessels and between fishery participants (e.g., crew and hired captains) and that stakeholders that do not receive an allocation of harvest rights may see their remuneration decrease. Yet, empirically assessing these claims is difficult in almost all ITQs due to poor availability of longitudinal cost, earnings, and employment data. This paper evaluates these claims using vessel-level data to characterize impacts of a long-established ITQ program for Alaskan crab fisheries on the level and distribution of payments to claimant groups. We find that the share of vessel proceeds accruing to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined under the catch-share regime to make room for new payments to quota owners. Average daily payments to captains, crew, and vessel owners declined, albeit slightly, yet retained their pre-ITQ premia relative to compensation in other sectors. However, inequality in payments to workers and vessel owners declined after ITQs, as did the interseasonal volatility in compensation to workers, a measure of financial risk. Finally, we find that consolidation-induced increases in leasing costs have had little effect on workers' remuneration, but have reduced returns to vessel ownership.},

We investigate vessel and trip characteristics, as well as trip costs and revenues, before and after the implementation of the program. We find an increase in higher value products and associated revenue, as well as consolidation of catch on larger vessels, vessels taking longer trips, and those catching more per trip. Overall, we estimate that the program led to a measureable increase in fishing profits, mainly due to movement toward higher-value products. A back-of-the-envelope calculation results in an implied annual quota rental rate on the order of approximately 15-19{\%}of ex-vessel prices.},

Th e article provides spe- cifi c examples of how nature-society relationships among people, oceans, and fi sh are remade as privatization policies take root in fi shery systems. We conclude with an over- view of several strategies of resistance.

abstract = {In May of 2010 a new management system based on harvest cooperatives called " sectors " was implemented in the U.S. Northeast Multispecies Groundfish Fishery. Sectors are self-organized, self-managed groups of fishermen that receive an-nual catch entitlements. We hypothesize that the success and longevity of these sectors is likely to depend, in part, on the relationships amongst the members including their degree of trust and ability to collaborate. The value of these relationships and the ability to cooperate is commonly referred to as social capital. Prior to the implemen-tation of the new sector system, we conducted a survey to derive baseline measures of social capital for individual groundfish permit holders and sectors. We construct indi-ces of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust. We explore correlations between these social capital indices, characteristic of the vessels in the sectors, and various measures of economic performance of sectors.},

abstract = {A growing number of US fisheries are managed with catch share programs, which allocate exclusive shares of the total allowable catch from a fish stock to individuals, cooperatives, communities, or other entities. All of these catch share programs allow transferability of catch privileges in some form. Information on these transfers, particularly prices, could be valuable to fishery managers and to fishery participants to support management and business decisions and to increase efficiency of the catch share market itself. This article documents the availability and quality of data on transfers of catch privileges in fourteen US catch share programs. These catch share programs include several individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs and a number of programs that allocate catch privileges to self-organized cooperatives. Price information on catch share transfers is found to be limited or unavailable in most US catch share programs. Recommendations are made on how to improve the design of catch share programs and associated data collection systems to facilitate effective catch share markets, collection of catch share market data, and better use of information from catch share markets.},

@article{Brinson2016,
abstract = {In 2011 the National Marine Fisheries Service began a systematic collection of performance indicators for U.S. fisheries managed under catch shares. Catch shares are a fishery management tool that dedicate a secure share of quota allowing individual fishermen, fishing cooperatives, fishing communities, or other entities to harvest a fixed amount of fish. Catch share design varies widely across different programs and regions. Many programs share similar biological, social, and economic management objectives even though these design features are tailored to accommodate particular fishery characteristics. This paper evaluates fisheries using standardized indicators to measure the basic economic performance, regardless of catch share program design. Data collected were used to evaluate the economic and distribution effects of U.S. catch share programs. Catch share fishery performance is compared to a baseline period prior to implementation of the catch share program. Overall, the majority of objectives to improve the economic performance of catch share fisheries were achieved. Catch share programs have been effective in reducing fishing capacity. However, catch share programs have had distributional consequences as there are indications that consolidation is occurring in a number of programs. For example, there have been considerable reductions in the number of active vessels and entities holding quota share in the Alaska Halibut and Sablefish and the Mid-Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog catch share programs. However, it is important to note that the accumulation of ownership share may be less of a concern than consolidation in the use of quota. Thus, to the extent that consolidation is considered a management problem, it may be more effective to consider caps on the use of quota than by imposing more restrictive ownership caps.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the findings of two partly overlapping comparative international projects on government-industry interaction in fisheries management in the seven Nordic countries, the USA, Canada, Spain, France and New Zealand. Fisheries management agencies often rely on inputs from user groups in planning, implementation and enforcement of regulatory systems. User involvement in fisheries management is a controversial subject in most of the countries represented here. Too much or too little involvement seem equally problematic. The issue is not so much if and why user groups should be involved, as how, which is basically a political question. User participation is a means through which users are empowered, and there is always a possibility that some will win while others will lose or be left out entirely. However, the question of how user groups should be incorporated in the management process is also a question of institutional design. In this respect, great diversity is demonstrated in our case studies. This suggests that the question of how users should be involved has many possible answers - none of them easy. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

After implementation of the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) management system, there was a shift toward higher value product and a 105{\%} increase in per-unit revenue with the IVQ program. Additionally, landings are more spread out over the fishing season with an increase in the number of fishing days and fleet consolidation occurs over time with a shift toward larger vessels in the steel fleet. Finally, using cost estimates from a large fishing firm on the cost of steel vessel operation, variable harvesting profit is estimated to have increased from 34{\%} to 41{\%} of the ex-vessel revenue pre-IVQ to 63–65{\%} post.},

abstract = {Since the publication of Rosen's " Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets " , property value hedonics has become the workhorse model for valuing local public goods and amenities, despite a number of well-known and well-documented econometric problems. For example, Bartik (1987) and Epple (1987) each describe a source of endogeneity in the second stage of Rosen's two-step procedure that has proven difficult to overcome using standard econometric arguments. This problem has led researchers to avoid estimat-ing marginal willingness-to-pay functions altogether, relying instead on the first-stage hedonic price function, which can only be used to value marginal changes. In this pa-per, we propose a new econometric approach to recover the marginal willingness-to-pay function that avoids these endogeneity problems. With a parametric specification for the marginal willingness-to-pay function, our approach is both computationally light and easy to implement. We apply this estimator to data on large changes in violent crime rates in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Results indicate that marginal willingness to pay increases by between twenty to thirty cents with each additional case of violent crime per 100,000 residents, suggesting that simply using the first-stage hedonic price function to value non-marginal reductions in crime (like those that occurred during the 1990s) may lead to severely biased estimates of welfare.},

The marginal resource rent for the optimal extraction path grows at the real rate of interest, and the equilibrium resource price meets this condition, known as “Hotelling's rule”. This rule modifies under the model extensions to heterogeneous resources: the marginal rent falls if extraction switches from low-cost to high-cost resource stocks. We consider the models of resource pricing in the presence of a backstop technology, the Herfindahl principle that a lower-cost resource stock depletes before extraction switches to a higher-cost stock, and the principle of comparative advantage for a more general case of heterogeneous resources and consumers.},

@article{Brodziak2008,
abstract = {Rebuilding depleted fishery resources is a worldwide problem. In the U.S., the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSRA) of 2007 requires that "Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery...". However, translating this legal mandate into tangible goals and actions presents several technical challenges, especially for resources that have been chronically over-exploited. For example, maximum sustainable yields and biomass reference points are poorly estimated for stocks that have been overfished for a long period of time and are poorly defined unless sufficient data are available from periods of low-fishing mortality rates and relatively high-stock sizes. The conundrum of how to set meaningful rebuilding goals given limited information on the population dynamics and trophic interactions of a rebuilt stock can generally be addressed through adaptive management procedures incorporating learning about density-dependent population dynamics. Monitoring changes in life history parameters and recruitment is critical for successful rebuilding strategies realizing the full yield potential of rebuilt stocks while periodic re-evaluation of rebuilding targets is also needed to address uncertainties due to density dependence, trophic interactions or environmental factors. This paper summarizes the development and implementation of goals and strategies to rebuild New England groundfish stocks over the past decade. Management is particularly challenging because the true yield and population size potentials of these interacting stocks is unknown due to chronic overfishing throughout the modern history of the fishery, uncertainty in compensatory/depensatory population dynamics and in the degree of stationarity in environmental control of groundfish recruitment.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are one of the property rights instruments that have been employed to improve economic efficiency in fisheries. ITQs are not high-quality property rights in the basic fundamental marine resources on which fisheries are based. As a result ITQs cannot be expected to generate full efficiency in the use of these resources. This article examines to what extent ITQs are capable of generating economic efficiency in fisheries. It is shown that ITQs can greatly improve efficiency in fishing. Moreover, by including recreational fishers in the system, ITQs can strike an efficient balance between commercial and recreational fishing. On the negative side, it is shown that on their own, ITQs are not capable of generating full efficiency in fisheries. In particular, ITQs are not sufficient for setting the socially optimal total allowable catch, ensuring the optimal use of the ecosystem, or harmonizing fishing with conflicting uses of marine resources such as marine tourism, mining, and conservation. Potentially counteracting these limitations, ITQ holders as a group have an incentive to manage overall ecosystem use for the long-term benefit of their fishery and negotiate the adjustment of their fishing activity toward the interests of conflicting uses of the marine resources.(JEL: Q2, Q22, Q26, Q3). {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

We examine data for a multispecies trawl fishery before and after a transition from management under common-pool quotas to a fishery cooperative and note a substantial shift in postcooperative catch from bycatch and toward valuable target species. We examine the margins used to affect catch composition, finding that large- and finescale spatial decision making and avoidance of nightfishing were critical. We argue that the poor incentives for selectivity in many systems may obscure significant flexibility in multispecies production technologies.},

The universal policy response to this failure seems to consist of nothing more imaginative than the free gifting to the commercial fishing sector of permanent endowments of income and wealth under the utopian claims associated with individual transferable quotas (iTQs). it now seems that the fishing industry is to be entrusted to become exemplary stewards, to become efficient, to maximize resource rent, to stop racing for fish, and to make society better off. These exultant promises are rendered false by the incoherent models from fisheries economics that are confused about the essential concepts of: 1. efficiency 2. economic rent 3. resource rent 4. ricardian rent 5. average costs and average revenue among firms and across an industry 6. extra-normal profits 7. stewardship 8.

abstract = {Individual transferable quota (ITQ) markets are being used successfully to distribute quotas in single region and single species fisheries. In many parts of the world, the development of well crafted markets for multispecies or multiregional fisheries is still evolving. As a result, there exists an opportunity to inform policy by providing research insights into the relative merits of alternative market designs for such fisheries. This study explored the relative merits of a simultaneous ascending auction design and an iterative combinatorial auction design for a hypothetical multiple region quota market. In a simultaneous auction, separate auctions are run in parallel for individual species or regions. During intermediate rounds, fishers can adjust their bids in auction depending on their position in the other auction. In a combinatorial auction, a fisher can purchase a combination of quotas (or a package quota) for different fish species or regions in the same auction. Being able to acquire bundles of species or regions allows fishers to take advantage of complementarities. To date, the potentials of such auctions have not been thoroughly tested in fisheries quota markets. This study found that while a simultaneous auction design was more efficient than combinatorial auction design overall, combinatorial market design took fewer rounds to make final allocations and performed better in high synergy environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance. Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible. We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather. After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fisherman's probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82{\%} compared with only 31{\%} in the former race to fish fishery. Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79{\%}. These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries. catch shares | occupational safety | rights-based fisheries management | risk | sustainable fisheries},

The median number of crew positions per vessel increased slightly, annual crew days decreased, and crew wage as a percentage of revenue was nearly unchanged, even with the introduction of new costs. Median daily crew compensation increased from {\$}514 per day to {\$}776 after implementation of catch shares and annual compensation increased from {\$}33 thousand to {\$}39 thousand.

" Difference-in-difference-in-differences estimations, combined with vessel fixed effects, indicate that catch shares are associated with an increase in the number of days that a harvester spends at sea engaging in fishing activities, which implies a slowing of fishing effort, ceteris paribus. For the Pacific hake fishery, participation in the pollock fishery is a negative predictor of a harvester's days at sea in the target fishery. In the initial two years when the hake fishery was rationalized before the pollock fishery the pollock fishery served as a derby alternative for hake harvesters. Results also show that pollock and hake harvesters re-spond to changing economic conditions: fish or fish product prices are positive predic-tors of days at sea. For the Pacific hake catcher-processor fleet, an estimated increase in days at sea per ton of catch suggests that a harvester's fishing intensity has also slowed as a result of catch shares.},

We also evaluate the relationship between these social capital indicators and various measures of economic performance of sectors. The result suggests that the relationship between social capital and economic performance has strengthened over time.

This study constructs the F{\"{a}}re-Primont index to measure productivity change for the Mid-Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery over a 32 year time period, which includes both pre and post-ITQ time periods. The index is then combined with a biomass change index to arrive at a measure of biomass adjusted productivity change. Results show that when biomass changes are considered, positive productivity gains occurred throughout the time period. Further examination of contributions from entering and survivor vessels show that entering vessels had little impact on aggregate productivity, but on an individual basis, they eventually were equal in productivity to survivor vessels.},

abstract = {Fishers face multidimensional decisions: when to fish, what species to target, and how much gear to deploy. Most bioeconomic models assume single-species fisheries with perfectly elastic demand and focus on inter-seasonal dynamics. In real-world fisheries, vessels hold quotas for multiple species with heterogeneous biological and/or market conditions that vary intra-seasonally. We analyze within-season behavior in multispecies fisheries with individual fishing quotas, accounting for stock aggregations, capacity constraints, and downward-sloping demand. Numerical results demonstrate variation in harvest patterns. We specifically find: (1) harvests for species with downward-sloping demand tend to spread out; (2) spreading harvest of a high-value species can cause lower-value species to be harvested earlier in the season; and (3) harvest can be unresponsive or even respond negatively to biological aggregation when fishers balance incentives in multispecies settings. We test these using panel data from the Norwegian multispecies groundfish fishery and find evidence for all three. We extend the numerical model to account for transitions to management with individual fishing quotas in multispecies fisheries. We show that, under some circumstances, fishing seasons could contract or spread out.},

Stochastic growth transition matrices were constructed for each site based on the shell growth increments, assuming annual ring formation. These matrices were used to predict the annual growth of the scallops, which were com-pared with direct observations of growth obtained by repeated sampling. Additionally, the observed growth of the scallops was used to estimate the parameters of a stochastic von Bertalanffy model for each site, which were used to estimate the mean annual growth increments as a function of starting shell height. These were compared with the mean growth incre-ments on the shells. There was a close correspondence, in most cases, between the observed growth and the growth in-ferred from the shell rings, implying that the shell rings were formed annually. The lack of fishing mortality in the areas meant that there was no confounding of size-selective fishing with growth and allowed us to track cohorts longer than would otherwise have been possible.

abstract = {Recent work in ecology emphasized the spa-tial patchiness of marine resources. Fish and shellfish populations often occur in clumps or discrete patches of habitat with differ-ent population levels and dynamics in each patch. Patches are linked through a set of complex biological and oceanographic fac-tors. This new view has given rise to spatial marine management proposals, including per-manent marine reserves and rotating spatial closures. Reserve proposals are particularly popular among ecologists because closed areas can presumably augment the biomass in areas that were overharvested due to stochas-tic shocks or poor management practices. Little is known, however, about how indi-vidual harvesters would respond to spatial management. Economists can contribute sub-stantially to debates about spatial policies by building models that explain spatial behavior of commercial fishers.! Beliefs about profitability of different loca-tions are the most important determinants of location choice for commercial fishing, but they are unobservable. Differences in prof-itability are driven, in part, by the spatial het-erogeneity of the resource. In many fisheries, individual harvesters make discrete location choices across space on a daily basis. This paper addresses the connections that bridge fishers' observed data, the beliefs that the fishers formulate, and the resulting location choice behavior. The crux of the modeling problem is that we, as analysts, observe indi-vidual discrete choices and we observe the location-specific catch and revenue histories of individuals (information or data), and yet we do not really know how individuals pro-cess their data into beliefs. In these circum-stances, is it possible to make inferences simultaneously about behavioral responsive-ness and information processing? Can we use behavioral models to test hypotheses about search behavior? Is it possible to determine both how harvesters share information and how this sharing affects behavior? To address these questions, this paper looks at three aspects of information processing: the choice between structural and reduced-form models, information decay, and complexities of spa-tial search and information sharing.},

Using data from Northeast U.S. Fisheries for the fishing years 2010-2014, we show that the traditional representation of fishing activities as derived by speed rules leads to a severe misrepresentation of fishing grounds for gears other than bottom otter trawl. Predictions based on probability models outperform the simple speed rule in classifying VMS polls for sink gillnet and scallop dredge trips, gears with more complicated patterns of fishing than bottom otter trawlers, without adding substantial computational effort. While the speed rule tends to perform well for the classification of bottom otter trawl fishing locations, the probability model described performs at least as well in terms of prediction, and provides added value in terms of a conditional probability of fishing for each VMS poll, which can be used to weight these polls in research extensions. We also highlight issues, such as fleet dynamics, that historically have not been dealt with in the static speed rules most often used to predict fishing locations, but which can have significant impacts on the quality of predictions, and are most easily controlled for in a formal probability model.

The aggregate behaviour of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race-for-fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done - per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacentwaters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries.At these small scales, localfisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale fished stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

abstract = {A discrete choice model is applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the English and Welsh North Sea beam trawl fleet. Individual vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice, and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort, past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience) and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod 2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort, and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10{\%} misallocation of predicted effort for that year. ?? 2012.},

Fundamental to these studies is the consideration set (spatial alternatives) assumed by the researcher to be possessed by the decision agent. Often times this consideration set is assumed to be the entire spatial extent of the fishery. This research proposes the use of finite mixture modeling to endogenously estimate the formation of consideration sets and the method is applied to a unique spatial decision environment, the Atka mackerel fishery in the Aleutian Islands. Consideration sets are modeled using different macro-definitions of spatial regions to focus the micro-level spatial decision making within the fishery and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative macro-level spatial definitions. Results illustrate the biases associated with traditional consideration set assumptions by estimating fishermen's valua-tions for different high-value sites within the Aleutian Islands under alternative consideration set assumptions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how a model that assumes some structure on potential consideration sets reduces the dimensionality problems associated with other endogenous approaches to choice set definition.},

The models are used to explore spatial effort substitution in response to two marine reserves. Individual attributes from a survey of vessel captains are linked to each fisherman's observed daily trip informa- tion to control for observable heterogeneity. Some unobservable abundance information is captured by location- and species-specific constants and estimated by contraction mapping. The empirical results confirm that there is significant heterogeneity in fishermen's response to the formation of marine reserves. They also show that ignoring unobservable abundance information will lead to significant bias in predicting spatial fishing effort.},

abstract = {Given a paucity of empirical data, policy-makers are forced to rely on modeling to assess potential im-pacts of creating marine reserves to manage fisheries. Many modeling studies of reserves conclude that fishing yield will increase (or decrease only modestly) after creating a reserve in a heavily exploited fishery. However, much of the ma-rine reserves modeling ignores the spatial heterogeneity of fishing behavior. Contrary to empirical findings in fisheries science and economics, most models assume explicitly or implicitly that fishing effort is distributed uniformly over space. This paper demonstrates that by ignoring this hetero-geneity, yield-per-recruit models systematically overstate the yield gains (or understate the losses) from creating a reserve in a heavily exploited fishery. Conversely, at very low levels of exploitation, models that ignore heterogeneous fishing ef-fort overstate the fishing yield losses from creating a reserve. Starting with a standard yield-per-recruit model, the paper derives a yield surface that maps spatially differentiated fish-ing effort into total long-run fishing yield. It is the curvature of this surface that accounts for why the spatial distribution of fishing effort so greatly affects predicted changes from forming a reserve. The results apply generally to any model in which the long-run fishing yield has similar curvature to a two-patch Beverton-Holt model. A simulation of marine reserve forma-tion in the California red sea urchin fishery with Beverton-Holt recruitment, eleven patches, and common larval pool dispersal dynamics reinforces these results.},

abstract = {The complexity of small-scale fisheries makes it difficult to predict the allocation of fishing effort among alternative target species in mixed fisheries, resulting in limitation for fisheries management. One reason for the diffi- culty is that fishing effort has been assumed as an aggregate of different components, without consideration of fishers' decisions. In this paper, we use discrete choice models to identify factors involved in fishers' decisions about selecting target species on a daily basis. We analyze catch data, by species and fisher, from three fishing communities of Yucatan, Mexico, to contrast the following models: (i) random selection, (ii) economic motivation, and (iii) changes in resource availability. Our results show that fishers do not operate at random but consider information on resource avail- ability and revenues generated from previous trips before selecting or shifting a target. We compare the results among communities and also use the proposed models to predict changes in fishing effort levels given changes in species price and catch per unit effort. We stress the importance of understanding fishers' behavior when it comes to developing ap- propriate management policies.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed methodologies to model fisher behaviour with the aim of predicting the outcomes of decision-making on board a fishing vessel. Both short- and long-term processes (e.g. investment) impact fleet dynamics. The proposed structure of the models has tended to depend upon the nature of the fishery and the control variables (technical restrictions, quotas, effort control, and/or closed areas). For example, within the context of multi-stock, multi-fleet fisheries (mixed fisheries), a skipper will allocate effort (as input to the production process) to harvest a range of species. Spatial complexity is normally excluded in models of behaviour. In this paper, two spatial analyses are presented for modelling location choice: an analysis based on a random utility model (RUM), and a simplified simulation model of individual vessels that depends on the results of the RUM. These models are applied to the English beam-trawl fleet operating in the North Sea in 2000. The results from the RUM indicate that the number of trips, the average trip length, and the average effort in each ICES rectangle are significant variables affecting location choice, in addition to catch rate for the previous year (1999), weighted by value. The last result is used as an assumption in a simulation model of fishing effort, i.e. fishers make decisions on spatial location of operation on the basis of past catch rates. The simulation model is used to predict the distribution of the same fleet for one month during the temporary closure in the North Sea in 2001. The predicted values for effort relate well to the fishing patterns observed. Crown Copyright ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives.

abstract = {A temporally and spatially variable Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) was established as a marine protected area along the US west coast in 2002 to protect stocks of rockfishes Sebastes spp. Since the RCA falls within the region sampled annually by the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, we utilized data collected from 2003 to 2011 to evaluate whether establishment of the RCA influenced catch per unit effort (CPUE), species richness, and size distribution of demersal fishes. We compared CPUE and species richness among 3 management areas (continuously closed, periodically closed, and open to commercial bottom trawling) using analysis of covariance models that account for variability due to area, year, and depth. The most appropriate models for CPUE (35 species treated individually and aggregated into 6 subgroups) and species richness were selected using Akaike's information criterion. All of the best-fit models were highly significant (p {\textless} 0.0001), explaining 3 to 76{\%} of the variation in catch. For 27 species and 5 subgroups, mean CPUE was significantly greater within the area continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling relative to areas periodically closed or open. The most appropriate model for richness included area and year, and mean richness was greatest in the area continuously closed to trawling. Species-specific length composition distributions were calculated from subsampled individual lengths for 31 species. Significant differences in length frequency distributions were observed, with a higher proportion (∼65{\%}) of larger fish most often present in areas continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling (20 of 31 species) relative to other areas. Our data suggest that the RCA is an effective management tool for conserving not only rockfishes, but also other demersal fish species. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2014.},

Gained experience updates beliefs on expected payoffs and is used in a range of decisions each individual is facing. In this paper, we focus on the formation of beliefs about the payoffs associated with spatial choices set in an uncertain environment. We task ourselves with better understanding of day-to-day flexibility of actions as a result of continuous update of prior expectations. We built a model where private and common knowledge on expected economic returns blend and lead to divergence of expectations between individuals. This innovation expands the frontiers of spatio-temporal modeling of micro-behavior to offer a new insight on decay of information relevance with increasing spatial and temporal separation. Application to fishermen harvest location choices demonstrates the use of the model. Successful fisheries management must be able to accurately predict the response of fishermen to regulations with particular attention paid to flexible technologies which allow individuals to adjust effort and alter behavior. Good understanding of fishing locations choice and location adjustment flexibility can contribute substantially to a design of management practices with spatial components.},

We derive and estimate both a structural dynamic model using Bellman's equation, and a reduced-form static model with trip probability expressions mimicking those of the dynamic model. We illustrate an inherent identification problem in the reduced-form model that creates biased welfare estimates, and we discuss the general implications of this for the interpretation of preference parameters in static models.

Operations of the fishing gear mark checkpoints in a continuous complex decision-making process. Individual fisher behavior is modeled by identifying diversified choices over decision-space for an entire fishing trip, which allows inclusion of prior and current vessel locations and conditions among the explanatory variables. Among these factors are vessel capacity; departure and arrival port; duration of the fishing trip; daily and cumulative distance travelled, which provides a proxy for operation costs; expected revenue; oceanographic conditions; and tons of fish on board. The model uses a two-step decision process to capture the probability of a vessel choosing a specific fishing region for the first set and the probability of switching to (or staying in) a specific region to fish before returning to its landing port. The model provides a means to anticipate the success of marine resource management, and it can be used to evaluate fleet diversity in fisher behavior, the impact of climate variability, and the stability and resilience of complex coupled human and natural systems.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been widely proposed as a fisheries management tool in addition to their conservation purposes. Despite this, few studies have satisfactorily assessed the dynamics of fishers' adaptations to the loss of fishing grounds. Here we used data from before, during and after the implementation of the management plan of a temperate Atlantic multiple-use MPA to examine the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of different gears used by the artisanal fishing fleet. The position of vessels and gear types were obtained by visual surveys and related to spatial features of the marine park. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify heavily utilized patches for each fishing gear and time period. The contribution of individual vessels to each significant cluster was assessed to better understand fishers' choices. Different fisheries responded differently to the implementation of protection measures, with preferred habitats of target species driving much of the fishers' choices. Within each fishery, individual fishers showed distinct strategies with some operating in a broader area whereas others kept preferred territories. Our findings are based on reliable methods that can easily be applied in coastal multipurpose MPAs to monitor and assess fisheries and fishers responses to different management rules and protection levels. This paper is the first in-depth empirical study where fishers' choices from artisanal fisheries were analysed before, during and after the implementation of a MPA, thereby allowing a clearer understanding of the dynamics of local fisheries and providing significant lessons for marine conservation and management of coastal systems.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly proposed as a fisheries management tool besides their conservation purposes. When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protection, the dynamics of fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should be analyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, therefore compromising an understanding of fishers' preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishing grounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures. To fulfil this gap, here we assess the spatial and seasonal fishers' preferences from local artisanal fisheries (nets, traps, jigs and longlines) before the implementation of a MPA management plan (the Arr{\'{a}}bida Marine Park, Portugal). Zero inflated modelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the main drivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely related to the distribution of target species and associated habitats. Proximity to port, weather conditions and distance to coast are also important factors influencing, in different ways, these artisanal fisheries. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics of the distribution of artisanal fisheries operating multiple-gears and targeting multiple-species and are likely transferable to many coastal multiple-use MPAs where no baseline data exist. Moreover, the variety of responses and preferences found between gears and fishers before the establishment of zoning are important to understand the dynamics of local fisheries, to contribute to an ecosystem-based management and to improve both conservation and fisheries management decisions. Our study is one of the few characterizing fisheries dynamics and fishers' preferences before protection measures are implemented providing important lessons to the management of coastal fisheries where artisanal fisheries prevail. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and socialpsychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how management response to pollution in a fishery affects the incidence of economic damages. We develop a spatially explicit bioeconomic model which is used to examine the effects of an acute pollution event. Two scenarios are considered, both involving a prohibi- tion on shellfish harvesting in the area affected by pollution, but distinguished according to the freedom given to vessels to move out of the affected area. The model suggests that closing an area to fishing may have widespread economic repercussions if it is linked biologically or technically with others. The decision to allow or disallow boats to move from an affected area is shown to make a crucial difference in the level and variability of profits in the fishery system as a whole.},

We compare patterns under these two institutions and study how the differences in the patterns generated by these two institutions impact the design of regulatory schemes to internalize the externalities.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) may create challenges for stock assessments because most models are based on the assumption that fishing mortality is uniform in space. Using both actual data and simulations, we explored two approaches to the stock assessment of Georges Bank Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus), where fishery closures were implemented in December 1994. One approach modeled the stock in " aggregate" , using domed commercial selectivity functions for the time periods when the MPAs were closed to scallop fishing. In the second " split" approach, separate models were used for the scallops inside (closed areas) and outside (open areas) the MPAs. The aggregate model converged only in 17{\%} of the simulated runs, compared with 93{\%} convergence for the open and closed runs using the split approach. With actual data, and in those simulations where both methods converged, the two approaches gave similar results, although biomass estimates in the most recent years from the aggregate model tended to be biased low. The closed area model, and to a lesser extent the aggregate model, estimated natural mortality M fairly precisely, but open area model estimates of M were poorly defined. Retrospective patterns were reduced using the split approach and when natural mortality was estimated. We conclude that the split assessment approach is better for sea scallops, but it may be best to use both approaches for comparative purposes. ?? 2012 .},

We also find that the optimal harvest rule may include closure of some areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent basis (biological reserves).

We built a spatially explicit biological and economic model of the fishery to analyze the trade-offs between maintaining given levels of fish biomass and the net financial returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results of the scenarios we modeled suggested that a decrease in total allowable catch at high levels of harvest either increased net returns or lowered them only slightly, but increased biomass by up to 10{\%} for a wide range of reserve sizes and an increase in the reserve area from none to 16{\%} did not greatly change net returns at any catch level. Thus, catch shares and no-take reserves can be complementary and when these methods are used jointly they promote lower total allowable catches when harvest is relatively high and encourage larger no-take areas when they are small.},

abstract = {Increasing use of spatial management tools in fisheries requires an understanding of fleet response, and in particular to where displaced fishing effort is likely to move. We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of similar to 4{\%} higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43{\%} greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season.},

Fishers may be viewed as individual foragers, whose decisions are aimed at optimizing short-term gain, as in ideal free distribution (IFD) theory. Although IFD assumes all foragers to be equal, they are likely to differ in competitive abilities for different prey types or target species. Here, we present an IFD-like model of a fishing fleet consisting of two components with different competitive abilities for two target species, showing that spatial segregation can result from unequal interference competition, but also in the absence of interference competition. Differences in catch efficiency between vessels for target species in combination with differences in the spatial distribution of target species can result in spatial segregation among vessel groups. The theoretical results are used to interpret the observed spatial segregation of two components within the Dutch beam trawl fleet using observations from a vessel monitoring by satellite system. However, this study cannot pinpoint which of the processes included in the theoretical model is the prime cause of the segregation within the Dutch beam trawl fleet.},

abstract = {Conventional sectoral management and piecemeal governance are considered less and less appropriate in pursuit of sustainable development. Ecosystem based marine spatial management (EB-MSM) is an approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including human uses, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. Marine spatial planning and ocean zoning are emerging concepts that can support EB-MSM. EB-MSM is driven by high-level goals that managers aim to achieve through the implementation of measures. High-level goals and objectives need to be translated into more operational objectives before specific targets, limits and measures can be elaborated.Monitoring, evaluation and adaptation are necessary to ensure that marine management measures are both effective and efficient. Solid monitoring frameworks are the foundation of adaptive management, as they provide the necessary information to evaluate performance and the effectiveness of management actions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) - possibly set up in networks - constitute a key component in EB-MSM policies and practises and have been applied as a cornerstone in conservation of marine biodiversity, management of fish populations, development of coastal tourism, etc. Moreover, MPA experiences have provided methods and concepts (such as zoning) to a wider EB-MSM context. The assignment of values to biophysical features of the marine environment allows the direct assessment of related management choices and may assist EB-MSM.A range of monetary valuation techniques have been proposed to reduce attributes of goods and services to a single metric. However, in the marine environment such an approach is often over simplistic, and thus less reductive techniques may be necessary. Rather than producing a single metric, the results of non-monetary assessments guide policy allowing weight to be given as necessary to potential areas of conflict and consensus.Strategies to take into account climate change effects and geohazard risks in EB-MSM have been applied or proposed worldwide. EB-MSM regimes must be alert to such risks and flexible to account for changes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change, constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may represent effective adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {Research toward the impacts of climate change and human activities on marine ecosystems is challenged by the limitations of present-day ecosystem models to address the interrelated spatial dynamics between climate, ocean chemistry, marine food webs, and human systems. The work presented here, the spatial-temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial-temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The bioeconomic system is depicted with a metapopulation model where the subpopulations are connected by dispersal processes and are affected by the spatial distribution of harvesting effort. We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort, harvesting, and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal. Using a simple parameterization to explore qualitative properties in several specific examples, we find that second-best solutions blend or average results of the differentiated case and differ in intuitive ways from first-best optima. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In his seminal work on common property resources, H. Scott Gordon proposed that in a fishery with multiple grounds, effort would be distributed such that profit rates would be equal among them. Gordon's model relies on implicit assumptions that are inaccurate and lead to false conclusions in many cases. In this paper, we present an empirically estimated model of fishery and location choice for large trawlers in New England using a random-utility framework with a nested-logit model specification. We use the model to test the validity of a behavioral model developed from ethnographic interviews with skippers. (JEL Q22)},

abstract = {This article is an analysis of observed changes in the level of fishing effort and the spatial distribution of fishing effort following implementation of a marine reserve off the California coast. The Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) closes the area between depth contour based boundaries to commercial trawl fishing. In this analysis, commercial fishing vessels are grouped based on their level of fishing effort within the closed area prior to the closure in order to compare changes in effort levels between groups. The results suggest that the RCA may have had a small effect on the level of fishing effort in the California groundfish trawl fishery. Spatial distribution of fishing effort before and after implementation of the marine reserve is also compared. Some concentration of effort occurred along parts of the closed area boundaries. This pattern suggests the "fishing the line" behavior noted in the marine reserve literature, but other possible explanations exist including the effects of coincident changes in other regulations and changing bioeconomic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Fisheries models usually characterise the concentrations of fish and the distribution of the fishing fleet by spatial averages over large areas assuming homogeneous spatial characteristics. Many important management questions, such as those related to the spatial effects of closed areas, cannot be addressed by such models. This paper presents a model which describes the spatial movement of individual fish schools and the spatial response of individual fishing boats, and which can be applied on a much finer scale and thus can be used to analyse the scale-dependent development of the fishery. The motion of the fish is based on assumptions about time-dependent gradients in the relative attractiveness of nearby grid cells which motivate migrations based on feeding and spawning factors. The motion of fishing boats is modelled in a similar fashion, with the attractiveness of neighbouring cells based on historical catch records as a function of position and time of year, as well as whether current catch rates are high enough to justify staying in the same cell. Our model showed that marine reserves increase fish biomass but decrease fish catches. It is also indicated that marine reserves are of limited use when not combined with quotas of catches. Our findings also point that transfer rates of fish increase the benefits of marine reserves in terms of fish biomass but decrease fish catches. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Socioeconomic considerations should have an important place in reserve design. Systematic reserve-selection tools allow simultaneous optimization for ecological objectives while minimizing costs but are seldom used to incorporate socioeconomic costs in the reserve-design process. The sensitivity of this process to biodiversity data resolution has been studied widely but the issue of socioeconomic data resolution has not previously been considered. We therefore designed marine reserves for biodiversity conservation with the constraint of minimizing commercial fishing revenue losses and investigated how economic data resolution affected the results. Incorporating coarse-resolution economic data from official statistics generated reserves that were only marginally less costly to the fishery than those designed with no attempt to minimize economic impacts. An intensive survey yielded fine-resolution data that, when incorporated in the design process, substantially reduced predicted fishery losses. Such an approach could help minimize fisher displacement because the least profitable grounds are selected for the reserve. Other work has shown that low-resolution biodiversity data can lead to underestimation of the conservation value of some sites, and a risk of overlooking the most valuable areas, and we have similarly shown that low-resolution economic data can cause underestimation of the profitability of some sites and a risk of inadvertently including these in the reserve. Detailed socioeconomic data are therefore an essential input for the design of cost-effective reserve networks.},

Fisher behaviour refers to individual and group level action that reflects the psychological processing and social exchange of information in fisheries. Fisher behaviour is poorly conceptualized and explained in fisheries research, and the implications of fisher behaviour for governance outcomes remain uncertain. To address this gap, we present a systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature (n = 104 journal articles published from 2012 to 2017). Results highlight a typology of fisher behaviour and reveal insights into behavioural types and their explanations commonly used in conceptual and empirical models. This research reveals three major implications for governance. First, researchers can strengthen recommendations for governance by examining fisher behaviours as multilevel and multiscale phenomena. Second, researchers in governance can improve capacities to anticipate behavioural change with theoretical models that prioritize psychosocial variables, and interdisciplinary empirical research on the extrinsic factors that shape the fishers' psychosocial responses to change in a local context. Third, social and policy sciences research is needed to reveal the governance barriers and opportunities for using new models that incorporate fisher behaviour to develop, implement and evaluate fisheries policies.},

abstract = {Biomass and commercial catch rates of Atlantic sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus in the USA generally declined from the 1960s through the mid-1990s as fishing mortality increased. Sporadic large recruitment events temporarily increased landings but also encouraged higher overall fishing effort and thereby contributed to the long-term declines in resource abundance. In 1994, a number of new management measures were introduced, including a moratorium on new permits, limitations on days at sea, gear and crew restrictions, and year-round closed areas. During 1994-2005, the biomass of sea scallops in the U.S. sector of Georges Bank increased by a factor of about 18, while the biomass of sea scallops in the Middle Atlantic Bight increased by about eight times. These increases were primarily due to the area closures. Biomass in the Georges Bank closed areas was 25 times higher in 2005 than in 1994, and the 2005 level constituted over 80{\%} of the biomass in the U.S. portion of Georges Bank. Substantial increases in sea scallop abundance and biomass also occurred in two of the three areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight that were closed rotationally to sea scallop fishing for 3 years. Mean recruitment on Georges Bank did not significantly increase since the closures there, but very strong recruitment has been observed downstream of one of the mid-Atlantic rotational closures. In the open areas, responses to effort reduction measures were minimal until 1999, but biomass, commercial catch rates, and landings substantially increased during 1999-2005 due to effort controls and increased recruitment in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The recovery of U.S. sea scallop populations demonstrates that the combination of effort controls and area management can rapidly rebuild severely depleted fisheries.},

abstract = {Global concerns about CO2 emissions, national CO2 quotas, and rising fuel prices are incentives for the commercial fishing fleet industry to change their fishing practices and reduce fuel consumption, which constitutes a significant part of fishing costs. Vessel-based fuel consumption, energy efficiency (quantity of fish caught per litre of fuel used), and profitability are factors that we simulated in developing a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) for fishing vessel movements. The observed spatial and seasonal patterns of fishing effort for each fishing activity are evaluated against three alternative effort allocation scenarios for the assumed fishermen's adaptation to these factors: (A) preferring nearby fishing grounds rather than distant grounds with potentially larger catches and higher values, (B) shifting to other fisheries targeting resources located closer to the harbour, and (C) allocating effort towards optimising the expected area-specific profit per trip. The model is informed by data from each Danish fishing vessel {\textgreater}15m after coupling its high resolution spatial and temporal effort data (VMS) with data from logbook landing declarations, sales slips, vessel engine specifications, and fish and fuel prices. The outcomes of scenarios A and B indicate a trade-off between fuel savings and energy efficiency improvements when effort is displaced closer to the harbour compared to reductions in total landing amounts and profit. Scenario C indicates that historic effort allocation has actually been sub-optimal because increased profits from decreased fuel consumption and larger landings could have been obtained by applying a different spatial effort allocation. Based on recent advances in VMS and logbooks data analyses, this paper contributes to improve the modelling of fishing effort allocation, fuel consumption and catch distribution on a much disaggregated level compared to the fleet-based models we developed so far. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Uncertainties in the input parameters of yield-per-recruit and stock-recruit analyses are propagated to estimate uncertainty in reference points such as FMSY. These uncertainties are used to evaluate the tradeoffs between the risks of overfishing and stock collapse, and the cost of reduced expected yield due to setting fishing mortality below FMSY. At fishing mortalities near FMSY, reduction in fishing mortality substantially decreases the probability of overfishing and stock collapse in exchange for slightly reduced expected yield. At lower fishing mortality rates, the marginal benefit (in terms of lessened risk of overfishing and stock collapse) from further reductions in fishing mortality is less, and the cost in forgone yield is greater. Less resilient “low steepness” stocks require additional precaution due to the risk of complete population collapse. Marine protected areas can also reduce risks of collapse, but at a higher cost in terms of expected yield than effort reduction. Implementation uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty in achieving a fishing mortality target) increases the risk of overfishing as well the loss of yield due to precaution, except at fishing mortalities near or above FMSY.},

Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A case-study is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by demersal trawlers in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during the first quarter of the year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8-22{\%} while only 3-9{\%} of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced.

abstract = {In the last decade, various spatial and temporal methodologies were developed to investigate the processes that drive ecological and evolutionary patterns. However, these methods frequently fail to acknowledge that the observed patterns result from the overlap of different underlying processes. In order to understand how the patterns are formed, we must have recourse to methods that allow us to disentangle these simultaneous processes. Here we develop a hierarchical spatial predictive process (PP) combined with a separable temporal PP to disentangle and describe those overlapping processes in one very frequent setting in ecology and evolution: multilevel spatio-temporally indexed data. We present our methodology through a case study of fisheries discards and investigate for example whether the inclusion of the hierarchical structure and the temporal processes of the system alter the observed spatial patterns. Recently it is recognized that understanding the processes driving discards is essential to sustainably manage and conserve marine resources. The results show that consideration of multiple underlying processes dramatically changes the pattern and characteristics of the discards hot- and coldspots. In the Irish Sea, the inclusion of the hierarchical structure of the system leads to the reduction of the hot- and coldspots. Simultaneously, our model identifies key bi-annual fluctuations in the temporal process which, together with the variance associated at the level of individual fishing trips in the hierarchical structure of the data explained most of the variance driving discards. Whether the hierarchical, spatial and temporal processes are considered together or not can profoundly alter our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate mitigation measure. Misidentification of hotspots can culminate in inappropriate mitigation practices which can sometimes be irreversible. As the proposed method offers a unified approach for understanding the processes that drive observed patterns, many areas in ecology such as conservation and epidemiological studies can benefit from its use, increasing the effectiveness of management plans.},

abstract = {* Conservation science increasingly focuses on how ecosystem functioning is affected by anthropogenic pressures, which implies an understanding of the structural and functional changes in biological assemblages and requires indicators to detect such changes within a suitable time frame. * A novel approach that combines the spatial analysis of fishing gradients (based on vessel monitoring system records) with distance-based linear models was used to assess the response of several functional and structural metrics of fish assemblages to gradients of trawling, within four distinct habitat types. In addition, critical thresholds of trawling intensity were identified for the most sensitive metrics through piecewise regression models. * Overall, total biomass and dominance (i.e. number of species that make up 90{\%} of the total biomass) metrics as well as metrics representing vulnerable features (such as chondrichthyes, species with very low resilience and sedentary species) were shown to be sensitive to fishing. Our results suggest that decreasing trends in these indicators are likely to be associated with direct and indirect fishing effects acting synergistically on specific features of fish assemblages leading to its homogenization, with likely impacts on ecosystems resilience. * Critical thresholds at high, medium and low fishing intensity levels were identified depending on the metric used to assess fishing impacts, suggesting that it is difficult to define a single global target for fishing management as it ultimately will depend on management and conservation objectives (e.g. maintenance of biomass vs. maintenance of structure and function). * Synthesis and applications. A key goal of the applied approach was to provide short-term indicators that are sensitive to gradients of trawling intensity and can be extrapolated to a broader geographical region. The identification of thresholds of fishing pressure that fish assemblages can withstand before ecosystem functioning is altered is key for the development of indicators as warning mechanisms, as well as to assess performance measures for management. Understanding responses to other pressure sources (e.g. pollution, dredging) requires further research, and combining an integrative functional traits approach with a wider range of pressures may help make this achievable.},

The assumption was constant underlying resource availability. Now, an advanced version considers the underlying size-based dynamics of the targeted stocks for Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic Sea fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process is specific to the vessel catching power and to the encountered population abundances, based on disaggregated research survey data. The impact of the effort displacement on the fish stocks and the vessels' economic consequences were evaluated by simulating individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds, and ports. Some scenarios led to increased energy efficiency and profit while others such as fishing closures or fishermen optimization sometimes lowered the revenue by altering the spatiotemporal effort allocation. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the interactions between vessels or to the alteration of individual patterns. We demonstrate that integrating the spatial activity of vessels and fish abundance dynamics allow for more realistic predictions of fishermen behaviour, profits, and stock abundance.},

abstract = {There is broad consensus that the main problem facing fisheries globally is too many boats chasing too few fish. Unfortunately it is also possible to argue that there are too many proposed solutions and not enough practical answers to improving fisheries management. There is a deepening divide between those who propose alternative regulatory controls on fishers, including establishing large areas permanently closed to fishing, and those who argue for better alignment of incentives combined with broad participation of resource users in fishery management decisions (in simple terms, between top down and bottom up systems of governance). However despite the choice of policy instruments used, a consistent outcome is that resource users behave in a manner that is often unintended by the designers of the management system. Hence whilst uncertainty is broadly recognized as a pervasive feature of fisheries management, to date most of the attention has focussed on only part of that uncertainty – scientific uncertainty about the status of exploited resources. The effect of uncertainty generated on the human side of fisheries science and management has received much less attention. However, the uncertainty generated by unexpected resource user behaviour is critical as it has unplanned consequences and leads to unintended management outcomes. Using empirical evidence of unexpected resource user behaviour and reviewing current responses to unexpected management outcomes, we identify different approaches that both improve prediction of human behaviour in fisheries systems and identify management measures that are more robust to these sources of uncertainty. However, unless the micro scale drivers of human behaviour that contribute to macro scale implementation uncertainty are communicated effectively to managers and considered more regularly and in greater depth, unanticipated responses to management actions will continue to undermine management systems and threaten the sustainability of fisheries.},

abstract = {There can be considerable variation in fishing mortality risk among individuals in a stock, especially for sedentary or sessile species. An individual-based per-recruit model is proposed that can systematically deal with variability in fishing mortality among recruits. These variations can alter the yield per recruit (YPR) and biomass per recruit (BPR) that would be predicted from conventional theory. Where the YPR curve is concave, standard theory will tend to overestimate YPR, whereas the opposite will be true where the YPR curve is convex. Additionally, variations in fishing mortality among individuals can create a mismatch between conventional metrics of mean fishing mortality and that required to properly apply standard per-recruit theory. The concept of "recruit-weighted" fishing mortality is introduced to deal with this problem. An application of the model to the Atlantic sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, is presented that demonstrates that standard per-recruit theory may often misrepresent true YPR and BPR.},

To be relevant to actual open-ocean fisheries, discrete-choice models of ocean fisheries should avoid im-posing unrealistic assumptions about spatial decision-making while incorporating detailed and flexible geographic scales. An alternative approach based on poisson approximation can be theoretically consistent with RUM while permitting specification of a choice set of almost unlimited spatial detail. Exten-sion to nested and mixed logit models is straightforward. An application of the approach to spatial valuation of the North Pacific groundfish fishery shows that it can produce nearly identical results to those achieved by a conventional logit model.

abstract = {Ecological indicators of fishing pressure in space are an important part of the Data Collection Framework (DCF) established by the European Commission in its attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries. These indicators are devised to use the information provided by the Vessel Monitoring System, a mandatory tool for EU fishing vessels which allows to record fishing activity in space and time. This study reports and analyzes trends of DCF fishing pressure indicators in the years 2007-2010 for the Italian trawlers in seven Mediterranean geographic sub-areas and the related trends of landing per unit effort. In addition, new versions of these indicators are developed and their performances compared to the DCF ones by a simulation approach. The rationale for these new version of indicators is based on: (i) the development of a formal definition of "fishing ground", allowing for innovative statistical analyses of fishing patterns in space and time; (ii) the revision of issues affecting DCF indicators. Results provide: (i) the first extensive documentation of space use by fisheries through time; (ii) evidences of subtle yet significant changes in fishing pattern which, in agreement to other studies, indirectly support a decline of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean; (iii) improved versions of DCF fishing pressure indicators, obtained via the identification and analysis of fishing grounds and the assessment of aggregation by Gini's G index. The latter point could mark an important progress in order to overcome some critical weakness evidenced by DCF indicators. Moreover, the statistical identification and analysis of fishing grounds could represent a valuable insight in quantitative investigations of fisheries impacts and effects, even beyond indicators computation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMSs) combined with fisheries logbooks have the potential to provide an abundant source of data with greater spatial and temporal coverage than research surveys. However, to date it has not been demonstrated how well VMS-derived abundance or biomass indices reflect research survey results. In this study we compared biomass indices of scallops derived from (i) fishing vessel surveys, (ii) research vessel surveys, and (iii) fishery-dependent data using VMSs and logbooks. In most cases there were strong relationships between biomass indices of Pecten maximus from fishing vessels and the research vessel. There were stronger relationships between P. maximus biomass indices from fishery-dependent VMS and logbook data and research vessel data at the beginning of the fishing season, when abundance was higher, but weaker relationships at the end of the fishing season. The time and location of sampling affected biomass estimates over short periods, and without standardizing to location and vessel, biomass depletion was masked. Fishery-dependent data provides a valid means of assessing relative scallop abundance and may prove equally viable in other fisheries with appropriate standardization of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data, making real-time management of fisheries increasingly feasible.},

On the negative side, one has to be very critical of using automatically the mean-variance criterion for choice among risky ventures. In fact, any variation of such a criterion, based on the mean and the variance alone, is generally invalid. The identification of riskiness with variance, or with any other single measure of dispersion, is clearly unsound. There are many obvious cases, where more dispersion is desirable, if it is accompanied by an upward shift in the location of the distribution, or by an increasing positive asymmetry. A more detailed analysis of the relation between skewness and risk is a desirable route to follow, if one is trying to restrict the information about distributions to a small number of parameters. The present analysis is carried out in terms of a single dimension, both for the utility functions and for the probability distributions.},

abstract = {All fisheries-management models incorporate simplifying assumptions about ecologi-cal and oceanographic mechanisms that are fundamentally uncertain or stochastic, but exploited fisheries are also subject to equally important uncertainties associated with fisherman behavior. Fishermen make decisions ranging from long-term entry/exit deci-sions to daily or even hourly decisions about where and how to fish. These decisions are influenced by regulations, technology, weather, and expectations about prices, costs, and abundance. They ultimately determine the spatial and temporal pattern of mortality in an exploited fishery. Although biologists have tried to incorporate fisherman behavior into management models, much of the work is ad hoc, whereas economics has a rich tradition of both conceptual and empirical behavioral modeling. This paper is an attempt to dem-onstrate the potential usefulness of economics-based behavioral modeling, with data col-lected for biological management. A model of participation and spatial choice is con-structed, and the economic model is linked to a biological model of metapopulation dy-namics and used to forecast the implications of management measures that might be applied to the red sea urchin fishery in California. The results show that modeling spatial behavior strongly affects the predicted outcomes of management policies even if the policies are not spatial in character. Over the past two decades, prominent fisheries scientists have increasingly criticized conventional fisheries-management methods (cf Ludwig et al., 1993; Walters and Parma, 1996; Pitcher et al., 1998;). The standard argument supporting the critique is that fisher-ies populations are stochastic, patchy, and heterogeneous and are linked with highly un-predictable oceanographic processes including upwelling, currents, and wind. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio in commonly collected assessment data is low and simply not good enough to track variation in populations as it unfolds in a manner that might make it useful for immediate decisions. Under this modern view, attempting to pursue anything like a fishery-wide maximum-sustainable-yield policy by measuring and estimating stable yield functions and computing optimal harvests for such a complicated system is simply folly. Under the presumption that these criticisms and alternative depictions of marine eco-systems are correct, what kinds of policies and management strategies are appropriate? A consensus is beginning to emerge that new policies must be spatially explicit, reflecting the patchiness of real systems, the heterogeneity of productivity and other life-cycle fac-tors over space, and the kinds and character of mechanisms that link various elements of metapopulations (cf Walters, 1998, 2000). Although it is not clear what kinds of policies ought to replace old ones under these circumstances, one special subset of policy options that has received the most attention is the option of marine reserves (cf Coleman and Travis, 2000). The thinking of many is that protected zones can provide near fool-proof insurance against various measurement errors, management errors, or other stochastic events by providing sources for repopulation of local populations temporarily depleted by management mistakes or by the inability to set and enforce harvest targets accurately},

abstract = {Abstract Beginning in the 1960s, ecologists, mathematicians, and economists started developing a class of models, which today are referred to as bioeconomic models. These early models started with a difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of a biological resource. To this equation one might add a second difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of “harvesting effort.” Alternatively, one could formulate a dynamic optimization problem seeking to maximize discounted net benefit. These models provided important insights into the tragedy of the commons and policies that might promote optimal management. By the 1970s, more complex models were developed incorporating multispecies interactions, age-structured populations, and models with stochastic growth. In the late 1990s, spatial bioeconomic models were developed in recognition of the importance of location when managing biological resources. The objectives of this survey are to: (i) review some of the early models in bioeconomics, (ii) present some of the key spatial models in bioeconomics that have been used to assess the value of marine (no-take) reserves, and (iii) speculate on the direction of future research in spatial bioeconomics.},

Stochastic growth transition matrices were constructed for each site based on the shell growth increments, assuming annual ring formation. These matrices were used to predict the annual growth of the scallops, which were compared with direct observations of growth obtained by repeated sampling. Additionally, the observed growth of the scallops was used to estimate the parameters of a stochastic von Bertalanffy model for each site, which were used to estimate the mean annual growth increments as a function of starting shell height. These were compared with the mean growth increments on the shells. There was a close correspondence, in most cases, between the observed growth and the growth in ferred from the shell rings, implying that the shell rings were formed annually. The lack of fishing mortality in the areasmeant that there was no confounding of size-selective fishing with growth and allowed us to track cohorts longer than would otherwise have been possible.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is often used in fisheries science to evaluate the effects of different management options. MSE models typically include a stock assessment component to estimate population size and management reference points based on data generated using the model, but including a full assessment within an MSE can be computationally intensive. A commonly used alternative to the full assessment approach is to simulate the error about the stock assessment outcomes as a stochastic process with an assumed level of autocorrelated estimation error. There is little guidance on what might be a reasonable assumed amount of autocorrelation, and what factors might influence this amount. We estimate the amount of temporal autocorrelation in errors of estimated biomass and recruitment from statistical catch at age stock assessment models over a series of scenarios spanning life histories, exploitation levels, recruitment variability, and data quality. Autocorrelation in the error in biomass estimates (. ϕ<inf>S</inf>) was positive and relatively high, with median estimates ranging between 0.7 and 0.9. Estimates were highest for the long-lived life history and lowest for the short-lived life history. Exploitation level also affected the amount of autocorrelation, with higher values for lightly exploited populations. On average, however, estimates of ϕ<inf>S</inf> did not change over time as more data were included in the assessment, and were independent of whether or not a harvest policy was applied. Recruitment variability and data quality had relatively minor effects on autocorrelation of errors.},

We compared this origin-informed assessment model with a standard assessment model that did not parse catch. We additionally evaluated the influence of including annual recruitment penalties. For standard assessment models, spawning stock biomass estimates could be unstable and biased (sometimes by more than 50%), depending upon population mixing and productivity, and in some cases estimated near average zero recruitment in the terminal year. Incorporating information on population-specific harvest age composition improved spawning stock biomass estimation (e.g., by sometimes essentially removing 50% biases and improving accuracy). Assessments with recruitment penalties produced less biased terminal recruitment estimates (sometimes a 100% bias was removed). Under status quo target mortality rates, improvements in assessments did not necessarily translate to improved fishery management performance (e.g., avoiding depletion of spawning biomass), but such improvements, and overall better performance, were seen at lower target mortality rates.},

abstract = {The concept of an optimum yield at intermediate levels of fishing (the so called maximum sustainable yield or MSY) has been with us since the 1930s and is now enshrined in legislation as a key objective of fisheries management. The concept seems intuitively reasonable and is readily applicable to a single stock treated in isolation and assuming a constant environment. However, translating this concept into a mixed and multispecies fishery, where there are complex trade-offs between fleets and stocks and in general no simple optimum solution, has been problematic. Here I introduce a framework for thinking about multispecies MSY in terms of an integrated risk of stock depletion and expected long-term yield. Within this framework I consider the performance of a set of simple harvest control rules based upon a single-limit fishing mortality rate (F) which is common to all stocks and a target biomass which is a set fraction of a stock's virgin biomass. Using a multispecies management strategy evaluation, I compare expected outcomes for a set of these harvest control rules with alternative scenarios, in which each stock has its own F based on the assessment process. I find that the simple framework can produce outcomes that are similar to those from the more sophisticated estimates of F. I therefore conclude that achieving multispecies MSY may depend more upon setting reasonable biomass targets and faithfully applying a harvest control rule approach rather than determining the best possible Fs for each stock.},

In particular, different ecosystem modeling approaches can fit within the MSE process to meet particular natural resource management needs.

Compared to many harvested fish and shellfish, their life history is relatively unknown. They are undergoing contraction in the southern and inshore parts of their range, as well as expansion into deeper water. Atlantic surfclam are thermally sensitive, and the changes in their distribution track changes in maximum bottom temperature. Sessile species cannot emigrate and are limited to recruitment and mortality as mechanisms for redistribution in response to changing climate. Management of Atlantic surfclam should account for these challenges. We describe a simulation designed to calculate biological reference points that will work well for Atlantic surfclam relative to biological and fishery goals, over a range of life history parameters, assessment uncertainties, and increases in temperature. Simulations of the trade-off between somatic growth and mortality under increased temperature led to target fishing mortality rates higher than the status quo, but also to increased variability in yield. Results suggest that increasing temperature may adversely affect the Atlantic surfclam industry, which prefers stable catches to short term increases in yield, due to market limitations. The results of this analysis are specific to Atlantic surfclam, but the methods described here could be used to enhance management for other harvested species facing similar challenges.},

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is commonly used to quantify conservation and economic trade-offs of alternative management strategies, but computational constraints can impede the representation of all sources of uncertainty. We conducted a simplified MSE for the golden king crab that focused on what we regarded as the major uncertainties, including initial stock abundance, future recruitment, estimation of mature male biomass and abundance, and catch implementation error, while capturing the existing unique federal and state cooperative management framework for crab stocks in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The simplified MSE identified recruitment variability as the most important factor in determining overall fishery performance, and conservation and economic metrics highlight benefits of a 15% over a 30% exploitation rate. We feel this simplified approach results in a robust analysis despite the reduced computational demands compared with those of a full MSE. Similar approaches can be used for other stocks, but managers must define management objectives, consider stock dynamics, and identify factors likely to have the greatest effect on expected performance.},

One of the quantitative methods available to advance in the process of validating simulation models is global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, its use in fisheries management has been very limited. When GSA is applied to management strategy evaluation implementations, it can also help manage available resources efficiently with respect to uncertainty in the management process and the conditioning of simulation models. Mixed-fisheries management plans were recently implemented for demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic, which were evaluated previously using complex bioeconomic models. Here, we applied GSA to the model used in Iberian waters, employing an efficient model design to introduce uncertainty in every single input factor. While most biological factors contributed significantly to the variance of results, only few economic factors did. Moreover, we found that increasing accuracy in the stock assessment process would mainly impact management advice and that only the management of target stocks had a real impact on the system. This highlights the importance of properly managing hake (Merluccius merluccius), which is currently managed using an empirical harvest control rule.},

Management strategy evaluation employed a mass-balanced ecosystem operating model and accounted for parameter uncertainty, stock assessment error, and strategy implementation error through Monte Carlo resampling. Results revealed a notable trade-off between stable herring catches and high biomasses of herring and several predators. Herring biomass control point values influenced this trade-off more than harvest control rule form. All British Columbia and Alaska strategies yielded similar ecological and socioeconomic impacts relative to the unfished herring baseline. Precautionary strategies recommended for forage fish combined high ecosystem benefits and socioeconomic costs. Reducing fishing mortality fourfold within an existing strategy suggested a possible compromise solution to this trade-off. However, ecological impacts of all strategies were sensitive to operating model parameter uncertainty, stock assessment error, and strategy implementation error, with the potential for undesirable ecosystem states across all strategies.

The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of "pretty good yield", implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

abstract = {Scientists feel discomfort when they are asked to create certainty, where none exists, for use as an alibi in policy-making. Recently, the scientific literature has drawn attention to some pitfalls of simulation-based fisheries management-strategy evaluation (MSE). For example, while estimates concerning central tendencies of distributions of simulation outcomes are usually fairly robust because they are conditioned on ample data, estimates concerning the tails of distributions (such as the probability of falling below a critical biomass) are usually conditional on few data and thus often rely on assumptions that have no strong knowledge base. The clients of scientific advice, such as the European Commission, are embracing the mechanization of the evaluation of proposed Harvest Control Rules against the precautionary principle and management objectives. Where the fisheries management institutions aim for simple answers from the scientists, giving 'green/red light' to a proposed management strategy, the scientists are forced into a split position between satisfying the demands of their advisory role and living up to the standards of scientific rigour. We argue against the mechanization of scientific advice that aims to incorporate all relevant processes into one big model algorithm that, after construction, can be run without circumspection. We rather encourage that fisheries advice should be a dynamic process of expert judgement, incorporating separate parallel concurrent, lines of scientific evidence, from quantitative and qualitative modelling exercises and factual knowledge of the biology and the fishery dynamics. This process can be formalized to a certain degree and can easily accommodate stakeholder viewpoints. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The possible impacts of the European Commission's proposed North Sea Multi-Annual Plan are evaluated in terms of its likely outcomes to achieve management objectives for fishing pressure, species' biomass, fishery yield, the landed value of key species and ecosystem objectives. The method applies management strategy evaluation procedures that employ an ecosystem model of the North Sea and its fisheries as the operating model. Taking five key dimensions of the proposed plan, it identifies those areas that are key to its successful performance. Overwhelmingly, choices in the options for the implementation of regulatory measures on discarding practices outweigh the effects of options related to fishing within ranges associated with ‘pretty good yield', the way that biomass conservation safeguard mechanisms are applied and the timeframe for achieving fishing mortality targets. The impact of safeguard options and ranges in fishing mortality become important only when stock biomass is close to its reference points. The fifth dimension–taking into account wider conservation and ecosystem objectives—reveals that discard policy has a big impact on conservation species, but also that the type of harvest control rule can play an important role in limiting risks to stocks by ‘applying the brakes' early. The consequences to fisheries however is heightened risk to their viability, thus exposing the sustainability trade-offs faced with balancing societal pressures for blue growth and enhanced conservation. It also reveals the wider ecosystem impacts that emphasise the connectivity between the demersal and pelagic realms, and thus, the importance of not treating the demersal NSMAP in isolation from other management plans. When stocks are below their biomass reference points, low F strategies lead to better long term economic performance, but for stocks consistently above biomass reference points, high F strategies lead to higher long term value. Nephrops and whiting often show contradictory responses to the strategies because changes in their predators abundance affects their abundance and success of their fisheries.},

Daily fishing effort is adaptively managed to achieve stock-specific escapement goals. Traditional methods for defining these goals relied on stock–recruitment analysis; however, this approach often ignores three fundamental sources of uncertainty: estimation error, implementation uncertainty, and time-varying recruitment dynamics. To compare escapement goal alternatives, we conducted a management strategy evaluation that simulated time-varying recruitment across production regimes and replicated the daily in-season management process. Results indicate (i) implementation uncertainty can be reasonably approximated with simple rules reflecting fishery managers' daily decision process; (ii) despite implementation uncertainty, escapement goals are likely to be realized or exceeded, on average; and (iii) management strategies targeting escapement levels estimated by traditional methods to produce maximum sustainable yield may result in lower catch and greater variability in fishing opportunity compared with a strategy with defining high and low escapement goals that are targeted depending on assessed run size, which may maximize future catch while reducing the frequency of extremely low harvests.},

Application to simulated abundance and escapement data suggested that model-projected rebuilding times generally corresponded to simulated rebuilding times as raw errors were median unbiased. Simulations also suggested that results were generally robust to parameter misspecification and that increased levels of lag-1 autocorrelation in abundance were associated with longer rebuilding periods. The application of the model to five overfished stocks in 2018–2019 illustrated the differences in projected rebuilding times under alternative rebuilding management strategies. The model filled a need for relatively rapid assessment of alternative rebuilding strategies for Pacific salmon stocks, a need that will likely remain given current biological reference points and fluctuations in salmon abundance.},

@article{Winship2013,
abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a simulation method commonly used to evaluate the expected performance of harvest strategies with respect to target populations. However, MSE is also useful for evaluating strategies designed to manage incidental take from endangered populations. We adapted MSE to the case of Sacramento River winter Chinook salmon, an endangered population that is subject to incidental take by mixed-stock ocean salmon fisheries that target more abundant stocks. Pursuant to the US Endangered Species Act, the US National Marine Fisheries Service called for a new fishery management strategy that would link the allowable fishing mortality to the population's risk of extinction. Our objective was to evaluate extinction risk under different harvest strategies. We simulated the dynamics of the salmon population and the management process simultaneously. The management process included harvest strategies that set allowable fishing mortality rates as a function of population size. Strategies that reduced fishing mortality rates in response to low estimates of population size resulted in lower extinction risk than strategies that set fishing mortality rates at current or historical levels. The number of years of data taken into account by a strategy and the extent of reductions in fishing mortality resulted in different frequencies and durations of reduced fishing opportunity. By quantifying the trade-off between the risk of extinction of an endangered population and the opportunity for fisheries to harvest target stocks, our study illustrated the utility of MSE for applications to endangered populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
