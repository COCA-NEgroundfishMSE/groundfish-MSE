## A structural economic model of targeting 

## A model of quota prices

The model of quota prices is built on the findings of Lee and Demarest 2022.  We make the following adjustments.
1.  We aggregate together GBE+GBW cod into GB cod and GBE+GBW haddock into GB haddock to match the choice set in the econometric model.
2.  We use model A3 from the Appendix. This is a model without spatial lag terms. Incorporating the spatial lag terms is difficult because of the aggregation of the GBE and GBW stocks.

## A model of stock dynamics
