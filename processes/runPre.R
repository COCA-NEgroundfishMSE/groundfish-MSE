# because it's probably a little better to compile once and then access the
# executable only -- certainly for when this is running on the HPCC as an
# array so you aren't trying to compile the same cpp file with multiple
# programs at once. Could include in the assessment R file, but if it's
# separate here it is easier for the HPCC to deal with.

# on Windows or Linux and whether this is an HPCC run or not.
