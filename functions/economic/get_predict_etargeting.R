# A function to do predictions for the economic targeting model. 
#
# tds: Combined dataset of targeting data and asclogit coefficients 
# I need to :
# A. compute xb. 
# B. exponentiate
# C. Compute the total, by id
# D. Compute prob = exp(xb)/total exp(xb)

#.Unsure if the NA are handled properly.  Also unsure if the "No Fish" option will be properly constructed (Troubleshoot: if the utility function equation is fixed AND I get a matrix of NAs, then the utility for the no-fish option isn't properly being constructed. I'm pretty sure that this gets set =0 (so exp(0)=1). There are no coefficients for no fish model.
# returns a data.table with extra columns in it (xb, expu, totexpu, and prhat).
