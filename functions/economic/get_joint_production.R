# A function to handle jointness in production (technical interactions) 
# Within the c_, l_, p_, q_, and r_ columns, the spstock2's need to be in the same order.
# Inputs
#  wt: The working_targeting_dataset that contains coefficients and independent variables. 
# 	
# Outputs: 
# a modified version of the wt data table withextra/overwritten columns
# the c_ columns start as "catch multipliers", but end up as "catch"
# the l_ columns start as "landings multipliers", but end up as "landings"
# The p_columns start as "lag prices", and end up as "lag revenue ==expected revenue, by stock"
# The q_columns start as "quota prices", and end up as "quota costs, by stock"
# the r_columns start as "prices", and end up as "actual revenue, by stock"
# exp_rev_total is updated as sum lag_price*landings minus sum quota_price*catch
# actual_rev_total is updated as sum price*landings minus sum quota_price*catch

  # This code looks really janky. It also looks fragile to reordering the catches, landings, daylimits, quotaprices, lagp, and 
  # prices vectors. But those are all set immediately above and depend on spstock_names. So, the order shoudl be okay.
